1,Deicide,"Behead the Prophet (No Lord Shall Live)
","Deny resurrection, behead the Nazarene son
Foredoomed holy spirit, our war at last be won
Legion crush Jehovah, see through the faceless dog
Untie our world from Satan
You know it can't be done
Wipe away this world of unworth
Decapitation, Satanic rebirth
Off with his head to sever his soul
Beheaded prophet the suffer is yours
""Forever.....""
Virgin, mother murdered, once warned but now is dead
Destroyed heaven's kingdom, in flames the righteous fled
Legion, thou has waited, beface the sacred dog
Satan's revelation, this world will always be ours
End of god the way it must be
Behead the prophet, let Satan free...
No god, no lord shall live
What always has should never been
No god, no lord shall live
Behead the prophet and we win
No man to begotten, infant Jesus dead
End of god forever, cast among the souls of Hell
Thou who has imprisoned, suffer by your own demise
Execrate the revelation, MASTER SATAN RISE!
Deny resurrection, behead the nazarene son
Foredoomed holy spirit, our war at last be won
Legion crush jehovah, see through the faceless dog
Untie our world from Satan
You know it can't be done
No god, no lord shall live
What always has should never been
No god, no lord shall live
Behead the prophet and we win

End of god forever, cast among the souls of Hell

2,Morbid Angel,Blessed Are the Sick,"[Verse 1]
Havohej another me born to serve
To plague and moan
So many years my seed condemned
Now free to roam

[Verse 2]
Will is yours? So creator
No intent could shadow (Shadow)
My disease, ugh
Ever lusting pain

[Chorus]
World of sickness
Blessed are we to taste life of sin

[Verse 3]
My touch is inhumane
Nocturnal beast inside
Is void of light
And empty shall remain

[Chorus]
World of sickness
Blessed are we to taste life of sin",
3,Immolation,Away From God,"Many times I've keeled before the lord not knowing he was at my feet
Why my pain, why my tears
Only now to see you were just man
You sit and watch, in all your splendor
On creator, it's you I now renounce
Everloving God, your love has failed me
I don't need your love...
Jesus, you couldn't save me
You couldn't save them
You couldn't save the world from misery
Hate my sin, Love my pain
You made us suffer, to your delight
To feel your anguish, will be my strength
Your broken kingdom, shall fall below
Once a time when I yearned to be at one with the Lord
Cheated by your false claims of divinity
I defy your word and rise in your disdain
to revoke you of your dominion
I am the darkness of the world
You couldn't save me
You couldn't save the them
You couldn't save the world from misery
Savior and Healer
The water you walked is drowning me
With glimpses of the highest reward
And the depths of the overwhelming promise
I confront him, the heavens before me
God fleeing, his presence swept away",
4,Incantation,Rotting With Your Christ,"Rotting with your Christ
I can see
The impending suffering
Your words vanishing
Christ for the weak

False
Messiah
Of
Mortality

Lord of lies
Rotting their minds
Bastard childs
We deny
Despise
His heavenly lies

I have freed
My mind of god
Condemn
Your kingdom come

Your
Mindless
Followers
We despise

Prophets for the weak
Your followers blinded
Dreams, eternal paradise
Rotting with your Christ

I see blood
And obliteration
Humanity's sake
This Jesus must die!
Rotting with your Christ",
5,Marduk,Glorification of the Black God,"Glorification of the black god
In the shape of a black goat - The dark lord himself
Presiding over the revelry..
Demons, witches, and spirits of Darkness await
And watch with pleasure on the succumbed virgins
And innocent souls.. Soon to be sacrificed
The only light is the gleam of the torches from the inverted women wombs
And the fire from the cauldron, in which human fat is being boiled
The air is filled with diabolical laughter and screams
Spells are whirling, and the smell of hell is spreading all around
The appearance of spirits of Darkness from the heart of Hell
A necromantical union brought forth to haunt the night
The Christians fled like pigs, overwhelmed with fear
Except glimpses of the moon surrounded by stars
Clouds block the nocturnal light, as the earth trembles
Under hooved feet accompanied by..
The beating of skins under the blackened sky
No one dares to tread the mountain on this night
They watch with enlarged eyes, in fear from afar
As the lightning joins the perverted dance at the bare mountain",
6,Mayhem,De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas,"Welcome to the elder ruins again
The wind whispers
Beside the deep forest
Darkness will show us the way

The sky has darkened
Thirteen as we are
We are collected woeful around a book
Made of human flesh

Heic Noenum Pax
Here is no peace
De Grandae Vus Antiquus Mulum Tristis
Arcanas Mysteria Scriptum

The books blood written pages open
Invoco Crentus Domini De Daemonium
We follow with our white eyes
The ceremonial proceeding

In the circle of stone coffins
We are standing with our black robes on
Holding the bowl with unholy water

7,Acheron,Fuck the Ways of Christ,"One should not embellish or dress up Christianity: it has waged a war to the
death against this higher type of man, it has excomminucated all the
fundamental instincts of this type, it has distilled evil, the Evil One, out
of these instincts - the strong human beings as the type of
reprehensibility, as the 'outcast'. Christianity has taken the side of
everything weak, base, illconstituted, it has made an ideal out of
opposition to the preservation instincts of strong life; it has depraved the
reason even of the intellectually strongest natures by teaching men to feel
supreme values of intellectuality as sinful, as misleading, as temptations
2000 years ago has been enough, it's time to cast out Christian thought
The worship of a bastard is absurd, these ways must be fought
No more confessions or worthless prayers, guilt and failth we don't need
Rely upon thy self, not some idol god, self preservation is key
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Adam and Eve were just a myth, evolution shows the proof
The meek shall never inherit the earth, Darwin, he wrote the truth
The words ""Thou shalt"" are for slaves not for those who rise above
Love thy neighbor"" is a fuckin' joke for few are worthy of my love
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Purification day has arrived, the Jesus freaks are revealing their ways
Soon the masses will wake up, that will be the Church's final days
Every empire that has stood strong has fallen in the past
Christianity is no exception, it's godly reign will never last
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ",

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Tellin' people their desire
Satan's sittin' there, he's smilin'
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no! No! Please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's comin' 'round the bend
People runnin' 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No! No! Please, no!

10,Blasphemer,You Are Nothing,"False idea of a supreme entity
Empty name gives voice to nothing

The time has come
To deny
Reject
The fraud
The fucking lies of Christ

You tried to impose on humans
By telling tales
Favoring the belief in evil!

Heard your comforting word, I never
Saw your shining light
I never
Wanted a god in my life

12,John Lennon,Imagine,"Imagine there's no heaven

Nothing to kill or die for

No need for greed or hunger

If you think that motherfucker is sacred
If you cover for another motherfucker
Who's a kiddie fucker
Fuck you, you're no better
Than the motherfucking rapist

And if you don't like the swearing
That this motherfucker forced from me
And reckon it shows moral
Or intellectual paucity
Then fuck you, motherfucker
This is language one employs
When one is fucking cross
About fuckers fucking boys

I don't give a fuck if calling
The Pope a motherfucker
Means you unthinkingly brand me
An unthinking apostate

This has nowt to do with other
Fucking Godly motherfuckers
I'm not interested now
In fucking scriptural debate

There are other fucking songs
And there are other fucking ways
I'll be a religious apologist
On other fucking days


And the fact remains if you protect
A single kiddie fucker
The Pope, or Prince or plumber
You're a fucking motherfucker

You see I don't give a fuck about
What any other fucker
Believes about Jesus
And his motherfucking mother

I've no problem with the spiritual beliefs
Of all these fuckers
While those beliefs don't impact
On the happiness of others

But if you build your Church on claims
Of fucking moral authority
And with threats of Hell impose it
On others in society

Then you, you motherfuckers
Can expect some fucking wrath
When it turns out you've been fucking us
In our motherfucking asses

So fuck the motherfucker
And fuck you, motherfucker
If you're still a motherfucking Papist
If he covered for a single motherfucker
Who's a kiddie fucker
Fuck the motherfucker
He's as evil as the rapist

And if you look into your motherfucking heart
And tell me true
If this motherfucking stupid fucking
Song offended you
With its filthy fucking language
And its fucking disrespect
If it made you feel angry
Go ahead and write a letter
But if you find me more offensive
Than the fucking possibility
That the Pope protected priests
While they were getting fucking fiddly
Then listen to me motherfucker
This here is a fact:
You are just as morally misguided
As that motherfucking, power hungry
Self-aggrandised bigot

Jesus saves
Listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When Death takes you away

For all respect, you cannot lust
In an invisible man, you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate, satanic rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves
No need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves
No words of praise
No Promised Land to take you to
There is no other way",

I feel that I should be heard loud and clear
We all need a big reduction in amount of tears
And all the people that you made in your own image
See them fighting in the street
'Cause they can't make opinions meet about God

Did you make mankind after we made you

I don't believe in-
I won't believe in Heaven and Hell
No saints, no sinners, no devil as well
No pearly gates, no thorny crown

Those lost at sea and never found
And it's the same the whole world 'round

wrathful beasts of satans fire

now soaked in froth and dark desire
at the threshold of the inverted womb
I stand
Surrounded by darkness
Amidst it's blackened clearness
there is naught to veil my sight
I can behold as they ascend
the malformes horrors of the night
and feel the crosses turn
each sense grow dim as if one with the dead
and as I fall on my knees to the ground
I am fed with the fumes of shallow graves
Into the starless night
I follow the stench
urged on by a thirst
that can not be quenched
into the starless night
I must go
the urge is so strong
it's all that I know
satan's hunger satan's hunger
The luring lament of a witch
the psalmes of angels fallen
the chanting of the undead
they echo in the wind
sanity and senses with the darkness now aligned
like tentacles and angelwings in foulest love entwined
and the graves begins to open
The brightest light will always cast the darkest shadows
shadows in which the truth lies concealed
for deep in the tunnels beyond
the dream of this world
the mysteries truely reveal
Into the starless night
I follow the stench
urged on by a thirst
that can not be quenched
into the starless night
I follow the call
urged on by a lust
that eliminates all

As your body enters the furnace
Searing fire begins its bath
As your entity begins its path
There will be no rebirth of your soul
Emptiness that clouds your depression
Forced in to see the light, knowing jesus wept
Only one thing clinging to your mind
The prayers to the feeble god whom you once beleived in
Looking at the mortal from your cauldron of pain
Weeping as you know nothing will make this end
But now an ever greater pain engulfs you
Reincremation did you no good, return to inflict others

They take the urn which contains what is left of your mortal life

The brutal burning of your soul, thought to cleanse",

Sit down I'm happy to greet you

My perpetual lust for the blood that I need

Fighting with scorpions, tied round my neck
I hear the pitter patter of a killer on the loose
Children use their fingers instead of words
Crosses burn our temples on Slaughter Avenue

Time is digging graves for the chosen few
Children digging graves for me and you

Start your two day life on a two day vacation

Spiritual cramp going for my ribs, those gangsters toting guns
Are shooting spikes through my wrist
Children use their fingers instead of words
Fingers bury children under the boards
I can die a thousand times, but I will always be here
With the power skull, secrets of forgotten years
The hangman's noose is drenched, with bloodstained tears
My hands are the killers that confirm my fears
Jesus, won't you touch me? Come into my heart
Where the hell are you when the fire starts?
I'm using my fingers, instead of words
I'm using my fingers, instead of words

Call out this prayer of vengeance
Speak to enemies through these wounds of redemption
Tearing out their eyes with horror

As the silence pleads this forgiveness
A senseless begging for absolution
Upon this entrance into oblivion
This fallen angel of defiance, destitute to isolation
Hold tight to liberation, in the form of reprisal
Project of this restored frame, in these pain filled alterations
This new threat of changing life restless in this completion
Powerless you crawl like pigs
Soon to be slaughtered
Suckling to a faith that you avidly hoped would save you all
These offerings will bring us our justice
For these years of diluted lies
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of gods
These hands held into the sky so the dark
Winds can taste the blood of murder
As the blackest hearts obey thoughts of
Deathlorn rites, endure the lust for revenge
Surrender the state of embracement and release
This life from the dark interiors
Discomfort of this assisted torment is given in these regards
A scourge of awakening
Prisoned in the rites of blood
Bestowed with ancient plagues, we will forge a disease
Of rape upon your ideals
Within this lifeblood we will find the truths as blades
Slice open their necks
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of gods
Once reconstructed the swarm will digest
The souls of this imperfection
Sterilizing faith-bringer has discharged
This assembly of this damnation

Curse me with your sick
In blood-filled walls I lie confined
Carving out the blind eye of God",

And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, ""Attack!""
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Night prowler, get out of my way
Yeah, I'm the night prowler, watch out tonight
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light
Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Yeah, I'm the night prowler, get out of my way

Crusted blood on the dead

But can you hear my cries?
Permeate me, oh night, as with the forest you did
for heart is cold, cold as ice
I drown in the colour of your eye
for a black heart will only find beauty in darkness
I breathe it's eternity to absorb the sky
where the shadows of death may lie
Feel the call - Nocturnal desire
Sorrow's breath - Enchanting cries
Night's blood - Taste damnation's wine
Feel the pain - Nocturnal desire
The devil's path of dark delight
Night's blood - Pure damnation's wine
Eyes are glowing, burn as hell's fire
Mark thy wisdom in my mind
Those who never was born
but whose darkness eternally
devastated the goodness built up through milleniums
No time passed, our victory is eternal
Our scorn, our silence...
A heart dies drowning in the night's blood
Everlasting malice for the wicked soul
Can't resist the night's sweet blood
Loneliness in the embrace of you autumn night
The night that froze my cries
Deep into the woods glows a fading light
I sold my soul, cold as ice
I drown in the colour of your eye
for a black heart will only find beauty in darkness

Of the dawn (of the) first millennium
Upon the thrones
In the shadow of the horns
Cleansed like the air in the night
World without end
a race of the cursed seeds
For five united forces
In the eternal dawn
The kings that held (their) heads high
The triumph of chaos has guided our path
We circles the holy Sinai our swords gave wings
Invisible force of our abyssic hate
Our seeds boil as we gaze upon the new millennium
Weeping by the graves of the glorious ones

Clouds gather across a freezing moon

Bitter things seek meaning
Even if they're madness to behold
Once forbears to horizons
Where the dead stayed dreaming
Now nightmares waken souls
That fear the living's toll
Gova, Bosch and Brueghel
Three times moonwise stain thy graves
For words alone are at loss to trace
The face of today's inhuman wraith
One half adrift in the vast abyss
Of despair and misery
The other a mask of rich red lips
Whetted by the fevers of belief and greed
All damned in this inferno
Where even Virgil averts his eyes
From the black mass mutual gang rape
Of Caesing hands an forced divides
Trespass these seven gates
To a world bloodlet to shades
Where Seraphim bleat
Of their cold and coming Master's race
In the seweres of Babylon
Stillborn to a trough anon
Chimiracles will hatch like plots
To dredge faeces to pearl their cross
Enter Penteholocaust
Five aeons past, yet still Man grasps
At final straws to save his cast
His Lord is a leper we shall not want
He betrayed us with white lies
His acrid pall as of the tomb
Reminds us how we rot inside
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appetites
Holding court to chaos
Folding to far graver arms
A downfall fatal to all resounds
As orgies peak in self centred psalms
And nature screams her sufferings
Under bowed and cankered wings
A bleak scorched Earth necrotica burning
Like the robes we've torn from her
She begs us lay her pain to rest
Lest we are left with nothingness
Save for her stripped and ravished flesh
And if her fate is not portent of Apocalypse
Then the comets that graxe nightskies
Will surely cleanse of wrongs and reichs
When you and I and all else dies
It's rotting down
This carcass Maggotropolis
Interdependent as worms to the grave
Allah's true name is naught
Chist cannot save
Locked in a waltz of evermore frantic steps
Spells of regret
Death Magick for Adepts
Be prepared to fulfill prophecies
The glorious fall of a sin dynasty
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appeitites
We've woven hearts a thorn arbour
Left tear streaked reason upon the shore
And bereft of compass, star or more
Set out for this World's end
Few at the prow, most slave below
Painting coal a perfect gold
But for all it's worth, the engines slow
Dead in the brine again
Come cabin fever, sodomy on the bounty
Prey to phallus seas
That hiss and foam to douse disease
A storm roars on the way
Blacker than the Ace of Rapes
Dealt out by Death in darkwood glades
Our ship of fools, all boards handmade
Sinks, dashed by seismic waves",

Decompose forever
Aware and unholy
Encased in marble and honey from the swarm
A thin coat of infernal whispering that bleaches from within
A darkness that defiles thought
Stolen by the wingless harpies whose memories lay waste the valley of diamonds
Where the great One sleeps
Her eyes
Placid pits of violent tar and bitumen regurgitated by demons chained to misery
Eyes that see nothing for there is only darkness that wells up from inside
A thick viscous cloud smothering hope
A blanket woven from the dung of the old ones
Their disease the tapestry of all that is futile
Her gaze burning holes in the veil that protects the chosen
Her breathe a plague that unleashes the frozen wolves
Blind
Their tongues paint your heart with scorpions
Their pestilence an invitation for the only one that matters for She is the presence that is all that is un-named
For it is Her
The begotten Mistress of eternal hunger
Dwell forever in her great unholy stomach where the damned befoul themselves in the glory of her fecund and bloody history
Worship in the torment of a million wasted lives
Bathe in the horror that the blood of time carries with the plague
And befoul yourself with worship
For she hate you eternally with the ferocious lust that binds all that inhabit the waste and forgotten
The blissful loathing of you is now all that remains

Forgotten and damned",

Stripped of your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy

Surgery with no anesthesia

Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die

Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of Death
Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last in this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain reach out for you
His face of death staring down, your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of the mutant he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims left to die
Rancid Angel of Death flying free

Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher

Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe?
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
'Cause in my dreams it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Night was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?
Six six six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Six six six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
Six six six, the number of the beast
Six six six, the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course",

The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand
He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
Would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
Swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
The sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had
A thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
For some time now behind the sultan's back and you
Could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
Dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert
Air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
Which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel sound),
Which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""
Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)
In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug with...
""Rings on her fingers and
Bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""
There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
Beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
Bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
Sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,
Watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
Magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
It's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist
Again like we did last summer, baby.!!"" Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
Give him one of the sly looks,
She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me

Have taken the very best

There was funky Billy Chin, and little Sammy Chung
He said, ""Here comes the big boss, let's get it on""
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand-new trip

I ought to say, ""No, no, no sir""
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside
Ugh, you're very pushy, you know?
I'd like to think of it as opportunistic
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is, ""No""
But, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb?
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when I touch your hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
Okay, fine, just another drink
That took a lot of convincing",

But remember one thing, don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread""

If you felt you didn't fit in
The French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank, minding my own, whoo

Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot

Getting desperate, indeed I was, yeah
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh, my dear, I better get outta here
For the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no
I moved right out east, yeah
Listen
On the Peeking ferry, I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yes, I was glad I found her, whoo-hoo
Wait a minute
I firmly believed that I
Didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God, I was glad I found her
And if they have the words I can tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats
'Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off, ha
You didn't have to come here anyway

And migrate into morpheus dimensions

A reunion for the deceased to achieve universal knowledge...
Seeking a destination of desolation
Far beyond the tormentor...
Forms out of fog, a permanent dusk

The night in which the myths are to be acknowledged...
If not so, dismemberment in return...
Embrace what destiny reveals, but you'll fall...
Thoughts of my agonies go back to when life was not entered

No one shall miss the secretions from your marrow...
Drenched in accumualated impurities, I would not let this
Slip by
An entity takes over your body, it is the keeper, guider...
Trust your mentor to the deep...
Your mind will wander as presentiments of your death
Peak to a state of confusion",

Acting like some stupid whore
He picked up his pride and took it outside
He just had to have him a drink
With his hand on his pistol he walked in a bar

And that's when he started to think
This life is turning from better to worse

The whole damn world's crazy he swore
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ?
Ain't there nothing sacred no more?

(Chorus) Ain't there nothing sacred no more, lord, ain't there nothing sacred no more?
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ? Ain't there nothing sacred no more

Seeking repentance, she went to the church
Expression was good for the soul
The preacher undressed her, and then he blessed her
By putting his faith in her hole
Two hours later, feeling the guilt
She finally confessed to the crime
Then you could see how they believed she wasn't out of her mind
What kind of preacher could stoop low enough
To make love to some common whore?
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ?
Ain't there nothing sacred no more?",

spread away!
Spread AIDS!
Spread it all over the place!
There are too many f****** people anyway...
And they're in my way!

Pale and thin,
wracked with pain
f***** dies, what a shame!
Contract disease and pass it on
Now you're here, then you're gone!
MTV and liberal spew
f*** the media, f*** the Jews!
They're the scum, one's who say:
""It's OK to be Gay!""

Ever notice that
there's a Jew behind every problem?
No fail.
Every time I turn around,
there's some Jew on TV
whining about Civil Rights.
It's OK.
Their Pro-f***** Propaganda's
working like a charm.
AIDS is spreading like wildfire,
and I couldn't be happier!
Really.
Give the virus to a friend
He'll infect another ten!
They'll, in turn,
kill some more
AIDS CRUSADE-World Tour!
Buy a ticket, join the show
If you're Gay, sign up and go!

That's right f*****,
you'll love it!
You can suck, f***, then die!
It's perfect!

Dead queer, dead d***
AIDS, to me, is outta sight!
One less f*****, one more day
I say spread, spread away!

Spread AIDS,
spread it all over the f****** place...
f*** you, f*****!
You know, they haven't found a cure for AIDS,
and I hope they never do.
We need AIDS. It's a good thing.
It weeds out the weak
the weak and the worthless.
It kills off the scum
The scum that doesn't deserve to live!

Hail AIDS! Hail AIDS!

Pale and thin, wracked with pain-f***** dies, what a shame! Contract disease and pass it on-Now you're here, then you're gone!

Fu*king dead! So long f*****!

MTV and liberal spew-Fu*k the media, fu*k the Jews! They're the scum, one's who say: ""It's OK to be Gay!""

It's a LIE! Don't believe it! It's a fu*king LIE! Propaganda! Jewish LIE!

There's only one way, one way to go: You better believe it, it's straight... It's fu*king straight!

Be straight, it pays! Sieg Heil! Hail AIDS! Be straight, it pays! Sieg Heil! Hail AIDS!

That's right, Jewboy... We fu*king Hail AIDS! We Hail AIDS! Kike!",

and the air that the prisoners breathe tastes so putrid...
So malevolent that it would make even the most immune
feel very nauseous from the very first gasp of air...

Such is the sickening Hail of this pit...
Known to someone as Hell...
Halls of Torture, Eternal Lair of Stillness
where moments of torture feel as mercy itself

Perpetual Monotony

""vomit...flesh...blood...murder...bodies...
ruler...tyrant...obey him""

Fixed Helpless onto these rotting walls
the doomed await the coming torment...

Inhaling the upsetting scent of corpses
and the repulsing smell of sulphur
arising from the pits below their very feet...

Vomiting their lungs out
hoping to die
but they wont...

The master enters his torture chamber
his minions wait for his commands
helpless prisoners moan of fear

everyone the master considered to be tortured,
were tortured, some of them died, some didn't
one day he?ll come back again to torment the
ones he doesn't appreciate

Burn swastikas onto his skin 1000 and 1 times with
this burning hot marking iron

times with this burning hot marking iron

Torture Allah:

Torture Hindu:
Stick your hand into his anus and pull out his

his guts, then feed him with the holy cow

Torture Martin Luther King:
Break His Bones
-I shall Break his bones
Cut off his penis
-I shall cut off his penis
Cut off his tongue
-I shall cut off his tongue
Burn ""White Power"" onto his forehead
-I shall burn ""White Power"" onto his forehead

Torture Lars Levi Lestadius:
Incinerate his offspring
-I shall...
Grind his bones while he still breathes and feed
them to Saint Paul
-I shall...

Torture Saint Paul:
Make him blind again and feed him his eyes
-I shall...

Torture all:
Vomit on everyone, Crush everyone's bones
Rape everyone, Burn everyone
post-mortem for everyone
-I shall.....

everyone left alive still wait for the next time.
the waiting is even more horrid than the torture
itself.

one of the hanging bodies still bleed a mixture of excrements and blood",

As throats are slit-troughs overflow as they bleed
To return what was
Before Eve and Adam
Babylon and Sodom
The trampling foot of man
Men, women and children shall be strung
Sliced from hands to feet
Innards save for a tasty treat and beaten profusely to tenderize the meat
Ah! The stench of the populace!
Millions of humans hung upon hooks
Suspended in deep freeze
Subzero, sterile environment keeps meat tender and lean
Choice cuts from the slaughter
Husband, mother, daughter
Dead families kept together
Their hides made into leather
Surprisingly, multiple uses for something so useless
We come in peace you go in pieces
Ah! The stench of the populace!
Freeze dried hogtied cryogenocide!

While wandering the streets, looking like you're lost

Giving you love you never experience at home
And providing wealth you could never earn from your home

The little sacrifice is innocence of your flat chest
And hairless secret place between your thin legs

Beyond the ""ass""-teroid belt
Where his body floats alone

The universe will burn

He plans eternal war
As the eternal way
But now there is a force that
Even he must obey

Time and the events within
Chronicles of hate and sin
Everything, it has a start
But the end is always the best part

And once that we have read the end

Brand Suid Afrika(Burn South Africa) Lyrics
[Afrikaans]
Vir jou is daar nog messe wat wag
In die bosse buite jou huis in die nag
Ons sal mos veilig wees, ons sal mos veilig wees
Ons hou ons gewetens skoon en sluit toe die deur

Ons het petrol gevat
En ons het al ons br?e afgebrand
Voor dat ons aan die anderkant was
En ek besef nou
En ek besef nou eers

Chorus
Bloed en yster, bloed en grond
Bloed en olie, bloed en grond
Bang en lui en desperaat
Daars niks nuuts onder die son nie
En in die skaduwee brand Suid-Afrika

Wat weet ek van eerlik wees?
My gewete syfer deur
My wakker lewe is deur die ou man se geheue
En ek besef nou
En ek besef nou eers

Chorus
Bloed en yster, bloed en grond
Bloed en olie, bloed en grond
Bang en lui en desperaat
Daars niks nuuts onder die son nie
En in die skaduwee brand Suid-Afrika",
197,Lord Mantis,Death Mask,"Enter the crease
Exits claim your anatomy

Seething natural scent
To resist is to fracture
And that this is the part
Of you that this allows

To the entry point
Conjoined eternal
The true allure
Is the pleasing noise
The last gasp

Run in reverse
Cruel colossal works
To the widows will
Dead hand in life
To accept
Is to tie the noose
Till the moment it leaves
The body wrecked
Seize and ressurect

Never ending in my mind
This crawls into the depths
Pulsing in my blood
Taste is buried inside
I see all fucking life in
Flame and that's what
Carries me on",

Inserted with appropriate timing

I ain't dining

And then there's some for you.""

When the ice that clings on to your beard

I said, ""Babe, with my boyish charm and good looks
How can you stand it for one more day?""

Alone with me

I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher

Of time for you
And do it again, it's true

There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

223,SANDY POSEY,Born a Woman,"It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor
Or if you're smart or dumb
A woman's place in this old world
Is under some man's thumb
And if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
You're born to be stepped on, lied to, cheated on
And treated like dirt
Ah if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
A woman's lot is to give and give
And go on giving
A woman's got to love and lose
And go on living
Well I was born a woman
I didn't have no say
And when my man finally comes home
He makes me glad it happened that way
Because to be his woman
No price is too great to pay
Yes I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way
Oh I was born a woman (fade out)",

But when I bought the tickets
She'd already changed her mind
She was turning out to be a real hard case
Nice legs shame about the boat race

Slower motions, roller coastin'

Take this photo if you for me, she said, ""Don't you ever show this""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless

Said your word get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is? I'm only lovin' for the moment
Uh, she ain't got a man but she's not alone

They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You'reX""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me",

Yeah, we danced on tabletops, and we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot last Friday night

So we hit the boulevard last Friday night
We went streaking in the park, skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a m?nage ? trois last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa
But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive (drive)
Shut up and drive, drive, drive (drive)
'Cause your Maybach ain't got what I got
Get it, get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari, huh, boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside
And ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride

264,Kate Nash ,Foundations,"Thursday night, everything's fine
Except you've got that look in your eye
When I'm telling a story and you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends
Then I'll use that voice that you find annoying
And say something like
""Yeah, intelligent input, darling
Why don't you just have another beer then?""
Then you'll call me a bitch
And everyone we're with will be embarrassed
And I won't give a shit
My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go
But I can't
And every time we fight, I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't
You said I must eat so many lemons
'Cause I am so bitter
I said, ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate
'Cause they are much fitter""
Yes, it was childish and you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared
But it gives me thrills to wind you up
My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go
But I can't
And every time we fight, I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't
Your face is pasty
'Cause you've gone and got so wasted
What a surprise, don't want to look at your face
'Cause it's making me sick
You've gone and got sick on my trainers
I only got these yesterday
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this
Well, I'll leave you there 'til the morning
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one
My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go
But I can't
And every time we fight, I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't
And every time we fight, I know it's not right

I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar going from door to door
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And old
To give a love, you gotta live a love
To live a love, you gotta be part of

You should know how it feels (hey!)
I saw this shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me (know me)
I decided to chill (okay!)
Conversation got heavy (hey)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out)
Oh (watch out)
She's saying ""Come get me"" (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, ""Baby, let's go""
When I told her (let's go)
I said
Yeah!
Shorty got down low and said ""Come and get me""
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So she's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)
(Let's go)
And I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me, hey
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty alright with me (hey, hey, hey)
The way she get low
I'm like ""Yeah"", just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like ""Yeah""
How the hell am I supposed to leave? (Let's go, bring the beat back!)
And I say
Yeah!
Shorty got down low and said ""Come and get me""
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (hey, hey, Luda!)
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And rraww, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in they birthday suit (yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (let's go)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead (hey)
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say
Yeah!
Shorty got down low and said ""Come and get me""
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take that, rewind it back
Usher got the voice to make your booty go
Take that, rewind it back

Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go",

293,Razorlight, In The Morning,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong
Maybe I've been here too long
The songs on the radio sound the same
Everybody just looks the same
But then last night was so much fun
And now your sheets are dirty
The streets are dirty too but
You never look back over what you've done
Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning, you know you won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be alright
Wake him up, warm him up
Put him on the stage, well
The boy can't help it, it's not his fault
Just a dangerous, dangerous age
But then every night's still so much fun
And you're still out there darling
Clinging on to the wrong ideas but
I never regret anything I've done
Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning you know it's gonna be alright
In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be all

We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape

Picked up the telephone, then dialed the seven digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby, are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door

Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
'Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?

She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, it's just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it

Between human beings and animals that you should know about

Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert
And you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch
You want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered
Like my Waffle House hash browns
Comin' quicker than FedEx, never reaching apex
Just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time

Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific, I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time""

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.
Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town
And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
I'm a thourough-bred
That's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road.
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
What? What?

Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh, "" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
Uh, I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit, you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out
A red carpet dick, it just roll out
Gon' 'head and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about up in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name? What's my name? What's my name? (Ah)
The sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in the middle of the barn (woo)
Or rose petals on the silk sheets (uh)
Eating fresh fruit, sweep your woman right off her feet
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy? (Ah, ah)
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex, make it hurt
In the garden, all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown
That's the way that I like it twerked
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the rope
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories are on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream, ""Help, "" play my game
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

340,Xscape,MY LITTLE SECRET,"[Intro by JD:]
See baby you're my little secret,
If you don't tell, I won't tell,
And that's how we gotta keep it.
[Repeat x2]

[Verse One (Kandi):]
Did anybody see you coming to my house last night?
When I got your message on my beeper,
That you wanna do everything I like,
Alright, alright.

[Bridge (LaTocha):]
I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend.
The fact that she don't know,
That really turns me on.
She'll never guess in a million years,
That we've got this thing going on.

[Chorus:]
You're my little secret,
And that's how we should keep it.
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I,
They think so, but they don't really know.
Or wanna know that,
You're my little secret,
And that's how we should keep it.
We should never let 'em know,
Never let it show.
If you know, like I know,
We should never let it go.

[Verse Two (Tiny):]
If anybody knew that it was you and your house,
That I was creepin' to all the time,
I'd probably still do it,
'Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind.

[Repeat Bridge & Chorus]

[Break (Kandi):]
Everybody cheats,
But you gotta know how, you gotta know when,
You gotta know why my infatuation with you,
Is taking me on an emotional high.
I'm caught all up in this love affair baby,
Speculation will bring us stares.
All my friends are asking me about it,
Still the truth I can't reveal.

[Repeat Chorus]

As long as I'm right here,
You ain't never gonna be by yourself.
'Cause the love that we share,
It stays on my mind,
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine.
[Repeat x2]

[Repeat Chorus]",

A big bow-wow-wow, 'cause we gon' make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dick, on the station that slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and looney, bitch, you can't do me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt, hoe

With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em

Third find a bag to hide the ho's face

Once had it down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay 'em undercover, always used a rubber
'Til I got caught fuckin' with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Call up the boys, went to her house
Charges the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where them niggas at
We left just in time and never came back
Rolled through the hood waving at the freaks

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it

Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?

Uh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there

[Intro: Eminem & Kim]
Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a [four]-year-old little [boy]
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!) So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We couldaX hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

I'm gonna make it hard to live

It ruins up her makeup and never wanna give
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits

Strong if I can but I am only a man
So I take her to the can
It's the wrong way
The only family that she's ever had
Is the seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine till the day she met me
Happy are you sad, want to shoot your dad
I'll do anything I can it's the wrong way

But I'm gonna make it hard to live

And it smears of her makeup and never wanna give
So we ran away

She took a hike it don't matter if I like it or not

In the garden, all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown
That's the way that I like it twerked
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the rope
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories are on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream, ""Help, "" play my game
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh, "" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh, "" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

When you go to DTP we give the people what they want
And when I come to hustle man you know we ain't no punk
And you catch me in the town we blowin' dro and gettin' drunk
And when we hit the party man you know we keep it crunk
You nigga actin' tough he on the floor and gettin' stomped
Don't act like you ain't know now tell your hoe to pass the blunt
You bitches wanna be me 'cause you know that I'm the shit
You see me on the TV 'cause I roll with Ludacris
Don't hate Shawnna baby just be mad at who you with (who you with)
I keep a couple handles so you know I'm too legit (too legit)
Just so you understand it so you know I'm 'bout that bread (I'm 'bout that bread)

And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication

452,Panic! at the Disco,New Perspective,"I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire
Because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
That changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watching
I'll lose the traits that worry me
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
Taking everything for granted
But we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion
Knowing everything is fine (everything is fine)
And I would wait and watch the hours
Fall in a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose
And wonder how I ended up inside (up inside)
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
Catch me up on getting out of here
More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you, I know
There's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead and watch me go
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't wanna live a life that is comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on getting out of here
So catch me up on getting out of here

I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you, I got this ring (ayy, ayy)
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk yo' shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (while you ride that dick)
You ain't never gotta fuck him for a thing
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet ass pussy
Look, I need a hard hitter, I need a deep stroke
I need a Henny drink, I need a weed smoker
Not a garden snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A-1, just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, and now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's going in dry, and it's coming out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (yuh, ah)
I spit on his mic' and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him some' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask, ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet ass pussy
I'm talking WAP, WAP, WAP, that's some wet ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet ass pussy, huh

This one coming at you B-style, Brovis
East Coast party style, bitches goin' crazy
Booty shakin' never ceases to amaze me
Girl, I wanna get you into my bed
But we ain't gonna sleep, we make love instead
Your vagina is a self-cleansing muscular tract
With over 50, 000 nerve cells ready to act
In fact, 6.5 inches side to side
And with a pH-value of 4.5
When you become aroused, blood flow increases
To the vagina, labia, and clitoris
The inner walls of the vulva expanding
As well as increasing vaginal lubrication
Let me see you work it, come on let me work it
I wanna see you work it, come on!
He means you gonna have sex
(You gotta work it)
He's not literally talking 'bout working, oh baby (you gotta work it)
You gotta work that body right
Again he's talking 'bout sex
(You gotta work it)
We're not talking 'bout a traditional employment situation (you gotta work it)
You gotta work that body right
Back in my crib, sippin' on the bubbles
Chillin' in my pool doin' time with my models
Bitches in the tub in oil and lube
It's the D-51 with aluminum tubes
We got five main nozzles in the front and the back
Driven by a motherfucking po-po-power pump pack
Got the non-slip surface and the stainless construction
And the FX2 faucet for the maximum suction
But what about bacteria?
How do I keep them from growing?
That's what I'm talking about, baby (my, my)
'Cause I've been worried 'bout the combination
Of water and aluminum and very high temperatures
But I guess I have to trust them, the jacuzzi factory
They're professionals, goddammit!
They should know how to do it!
Let me hear you blow!
(You gotta blow it)
He's not referring to the sucking of the cock
(You gotta blow it)
Not a metaphor this time baby
(You gotta blow it)
We're talking about actually blowing bubbles into water
Now he is talking about the pump

485,Garfunkel and Oates,The Loophole,"All my life I've been good
Do what my mom and dad and God say I should
Go to church and Bible School
To live by God's rule
So whatever people tell me
That The Bible tells me
I will do
Walk the halls of high school with my purity ring
Unlike those other girls, I've got my morals in check
It was easy to do 'til I got a boyfriend
And pardon my French, but he's cute as heck
But I made a pact to keep my hymen intact
And Jesus and I are tight
Never learned about the birds and bees
I was taught to keep an aspirin in between my knees
'Cause The Bible says premarital sex is wrong
But Jason says that, ""Guys can't wait that long""
I don't want to lose him
To someone who'll do him
I might need to figure something out
Well there's a loophole in The Scripture that works really well
So I can get him off without going to hell
It's my Hail Mary, full of grace
In Jesus' name, we go to fifth base!
Oh, thank you for making me holy
And thank you for giving me holes to choose from
And since I'm not a Godless whore
He'll have to come in the back door
Therefore
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see
It's hard to be as pure as me
To resist the urge to lose my vaginal virginity
To wait until my marriage bed
To give my husband my unsullied maidenhead
So take your cock out
Shove it in my ass
Fuck me until you cum
Oops! I mean let's join our souls and unite our bodies
And fly with the wings of God
Whatever you do, don't touch my clitoris
If you ring Satan's doorbell, God can't ignore this
And no prophylactics when you put it in
'Cause birth control's for sluts and it's a sin
I've emptied my bowels
And laid out the towels
I'm ready for romance
Now I'm praying to the Power that's the Highest
But of all of my holes, this one's the driest
And we can't procreate if we anally copulate
And God's OK with sodomy, but only if you're straight
And I'm staying pure, no matter what
So I'm OK with everything but...
Everything but...
Everything but...
Whoa, fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a rock hard rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see
I do whatever The Bible tells me to
Except for the parts that I choose to ignore
Because they're unrealistic and inconvenient
But the rest I live by for sure
So let's not talk about how the Good Book bans shellfish, polyester and divorce
And how it condones slavery and killing gays
'Cause those parts don't count, of course
Let's cherry-pick the part about losing my cherry and mine it for ambiguities and omissions
To circumvent any real sacrifice
But still feel pious in my arbitrary parroted positions
And don't you dare question my convictions
And don't look closely at the contradictions
Just focus on the sacrificial crucifixion
And have faith in its complete jurisdiction
As the only way to measure if you're good or not
And in a debate, just say, ""To have faith""
Because when you're up against logic, it's the only card you've got
So close your eyes, take a deep breath and...
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of an irrational rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see
Yeah, my chastity belt has locks
But sometimes you need to think outside the box",

Making him wish that your mother had raised you right

Well I'm a low down sucker
A poor mother fucker
My life is a bit of a rotten cunt but God damn you love her
Tilt that head back baby and I'll just like shoot one off in your mouth real quick
And if you wanted to blow a line or two
If that's the kinda thing that you like to do
And if you feel it go on drink till ya puke

529,Elvis Costello and the Attractions,Radio Radio,"I was tuning in the shine on the late night dial
Doing anything my radio advised
With every one of those late night stations
Playing songs bringing tears to my eyes
I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver
When the switch broke 'cause it's old
They're saying things that I can hardly believe
They really think we're getting out of control
Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do as you are told
You better listen to the radio
I wanna bite the hand that feeds me
I wanna bite that hand so badly
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me
Some of my friends sit around every evening
And they worry about the times ahead
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
And the promise of an early bed
You either shut up or get cut up, they don't wanna hear about it
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools
Tryin' to anesthetize the way that you feel
Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do as you are told

I've seen your face before my friend

And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood

To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Mo?t and Aliz? keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right, I like the life I live

And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said ""Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man""

Now check this out, uggh!
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and right
So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam
Step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back
The present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why

But the lesson plan he can't recall
The students' eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react

And proto-rapper who wrote ""The Revolution will not be Televised."" Much Respect.
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs

The real revolution ain't about booty size
The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives
And though we've lost Biggie Smalls
Baby your notorious revolution
Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush
Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees
Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
And produce little future emcees
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep
With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
Doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got
And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot
And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
Or helping you fantasize
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
No no, not between these thighs
Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
And really fantastic
And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla,
Butter pecan, chocolate delux
Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just cuz you made a few bucks?
Please brother please
Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense
But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
To express what you feel
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Will not happen between these thighs
Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking
Between these thighs
Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution
You know I'm talking about the revolution

It's gonna be real

And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack

No, they can't even feel it

Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight

And your heart it breaks

Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave

Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

It's catching you, but you don't see
The reaper's you and the reaper is me

Where to hide? Suicide is the only way out

Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy motherfuckin' E
Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the motherfuckin' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothin' but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A Young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo
Beat a police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young nigga on a warpath

Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin', ""Fuck you, punk""
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma fuck you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now, and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villian that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-

Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucka in a uniform waitin' to get shot
By me, or another nigga.
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin'
This is what I'll say

Fuck the police, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-

555,Dixie Chicks,Goodbye Earl,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl
Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married that
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care
Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die
Good bye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl
You feelin' weak?
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, ""Thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know""
Well, the weeks went by and spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night
'Cause Earl had to die
Good bye, Earl

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn You must not have got them
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f**k it, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'ma
name her Bonnie.
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some b**ch who didn't want him.
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan.
I even got the underground sh*t that you did with Scam.
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.
I like the sh*t you did with Ruckus too, that sh*t was phat.
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.
My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin why i got out of bed at all.
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all.
And even if i could it'd all be grey. with your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
I hope you have the chance.
I ain't mad, I just think it's f**ked up you don't answer fans.
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
you didn't have to, but you could have signed an autograph
for Matthew.
That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old.
We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours
and you just said no.
That's pretty sh*tty man, you're like his f**kin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more
than I do.
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to.
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I write you
You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way.
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.
So when I have a sh*tty day, I drift away and put 'em on.
Cause I don't really got sh*t else, so that sh*t helps
when I'm depressed.
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.
It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me.
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you
'cause you tell it.
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7.
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does.
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up.
You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan
you'll ever lose.
Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.
My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin why i got out of bed at all.

Dear Mr. I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.
It's been six months and still no word. I don't
deserve it.
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the
addresses on 'em perfect.
So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it.
I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. hey slim i drank
a 5th a vodca dare me to drive? you know that song by phil collins in
the air in the night about that guy who could've saved that other guy
from drowning but didn't and phil saw it all and at his show he found
him thats kinda how this is you could've rescued me from drowning
but its too late i'm on a thousand downers now i'm drowsy and all i
wanted was a lousy letter or a call i hope you know i ripped all your
pictures off the wall I loved you Slim, we could have been together.
Think about it.You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.
I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.
See Slim, {screaming} shut up b**ch, I'm trying to talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
But I didn't slit her throat,
I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,
then she'll die too.
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now.
Oh sh*t, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this sh*t out?
My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin why i got out of bed at all.
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all.
And even if i could it'd all be grey. with your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy.
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flatterd you'd call your daughter that.
And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it
on the Starter cap.
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you.
Don't think I did that sh*t intentionally, just to diss you.
but what's this sh*t you said about you
like to cut your wrists too?
I say that sh*t just clownin' dog,
c'mon, how f**ked up is she?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the
walls when you get down some.
And what's this sh*t about us meant to be together?
That type of sh*t'll make me not want us to meet each other.
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.
Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
I hope you get to read this letter.
I just hope it reaches you in time.
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin'
just fine
If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want
you as a fan.
I just don't want you to do some crazy sh*t.
I seen this one sh*t on the news a couple weeks ago
that made me sick.
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was
pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who
it was to
Come to think about it...his name was...it was you.

559,Brad Paisley,Accidental Racist,"To the man that waited on me
At the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt
The only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn
But from my point of view
I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday
And caught between southern pride and southern blame
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin
Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood
Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee but I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me, know what I mean)

It's six o'clock, I want to go home
But it's ""no way, "" ""not today""
Makes you wonder what it meant
And this hollow feeling grows and grows and grows and grows
And you want to call your mother

'Cause I seem to have left an important part of my brain somewhere
Somewhere in a field in Hampshire, all right""

We went to his place and his roommates were there
But I was so horny, I didn't even care
Before we knew it, we start to grind
Then suddenly I feel something in my behind
I start to tear up and my eyes go wide
Did he really just stick it inside of my back side
Oh my god, he just put his dick in my butthole
Last night, he stuck in the wrong hole
I was so shocked, from the bottom of my soul
That he stuck it in the wrong hole
I felt the sudden urge to have to go number 2
But to poo in his place I thought well that would be rude
I didn't have the nerve to tell him straight to his face
So I snuck out the back and I ran all the way to my place
Last night, he stuck in the wrong hole
I was so shocked, from the bottom of my soul
The very next week he texted everyday
Meanwhile my butt pain had finally all gone away
He sent flowers and candy and even a song
So he finally confessed that he got it all wrong
Hey Dj Lubelle, I hope that you don't mind
That I kinda liked when you put it in my behind
I know that I seem to be uptight
But can we just try it again tonight?

616,Vanessa Carlton,White Houses,"Crashed on the floor when I moved in
This little bungalow alone with some strange new friends
Stay up too late, and I'm too thin
We promise each other it's til the end
Now we're spinning empty bottles
It's the five of us
With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust
I can't resist the day
No, I can't resist the day
Jenny screams out and it's no pose
Cause when she dances she goes and goes
And beer through the nose on an inside joke
And I'm so excited, I haven't spoken
And she's so pretty, and she's so sure
Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her
The summer's all in bloom
The summer is ending soon
It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love and we all got hurt
I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat
Boy, we're going way too fast
It's all too sweet to last
It's alright
And I put myself in his hands
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
Love, or something ignites in my veins
And I pray it never fades in white houses
My first time, hard to explain
Rush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain
On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think
He's my first mistake
Maybe you were all faster than me
We gave each other up so easily
These silly little wounds will never mend
I feel so far from where I've been
So I go, and I will not be back here again
I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses
I lie, put my injuries all in the dust
In my heart is the five of us
In white houses
And you, maybe you'll remember me
What I gave is yours to keep
In white houses
In white houses
In white houses",
617,Britney Spears,Touch of My Hand,"I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world, so I can draw the blinds
And I'll teach myself to fly
I love myself, it's not a sin
I can't control what's happening
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's takin' over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand the touch of my hand
The small of my back, the arch of my feet

I'm all in my skin, and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way

On day one, I met her hot step-daughter
She's a cheerleader, she's a virgin, and she's really tan
As she stepped out of her massive car
I could only notice she was more than fuckable
I think she was coming back from the game or something
'Cause she was holding those silly pompoms
On day two, I fucked her, and it was wild
She's such a slut
I fucked my American cunt
I loved my English romance
I fucked my American cunt
I loved my English romance
It was dirty, a dream came true
Just like I like it, she's got nice tits
It was perfect, a dream came true
Just like a song by blink-182
Okay, listen girls
I met the hottest guy ever
Basically, as I was stepping out of my S.U.V.
I came face to face with my step-cousin or whatever, who cares?
Anyway, he was wearing skinny jeans, had funky hair
And the cutest British accent ever
Straight away I could tell he was a rocker
From his sexy attitude and the way he looked at me
Mmm, he is totally awesome
Oh my god, I think I'm in love!
I fucked my American cunt
I loved my English romance
I fucked my American cunt

Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out
Your discovery will take us to another place
Baby, on that, there is no doubt
I've been waiting for the special moment
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me
Make the first step to release my emotions
To take the road to ecstacy

Take it round and round
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness
Will be enough
That's the love that you've been dreaming of

Keep on doing, doing what you're doing
'Til you feel the passion burning up inside of me
If you do me right
We'll be making love all through the night
Until you uncover the mystery
Take it nice and slow
Baby, don't rush the feeling
Now you know how you can make it happen, yeah
My desire is begging for the healing
Let me guide you down to the place to be

To my sensitivity.

I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck

I got the money if you got the time
You said it feels good--I said I'll give it a try

We both forgot where your car was parked
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning
Bad actors with bad habits
Some sad singers
They just play tragic
And the phone's ringing
And the van's leaving

Let's just keep keep singing
I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals?
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind

And to hurt

""I do! I do!""
""Then hurt me.""",

She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She liked to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She'll only start talking about signin' the lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
An x-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than a tell on the well
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames in hell
I geed this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I met a lot of freaks in my life span
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Janie
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak, fat and slobby
I'll kick on back and watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a filthy little freak from China
I said, ""I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money, I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby""
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my house and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I'll tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Renee
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Renee, you can have it your way
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait

Let me tell you this since we're talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again at the pad I had it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I'm tryna get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a hooker, she did it for free
On the foothill bust number forty-three
All the way in the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again, I took a second look
'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept starin'
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, he cut out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door workin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
The homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad, her blood would boil
But I wrapped her all up like alluminium foil
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
Shake if you like, Friday night, it's goin' on, Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita, her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy, I geed her
Sent her on her way the very next day
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name's Rosanne
We hit the motel and had it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Cherie
I took her to my house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top, she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with her big fat titties
All night long she was actin' shitty
So I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Volvos
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when i met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to pom it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I'm the only man who ever called her honey
Everything I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight, a date with Shirley
She was real short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby, you'd like this girlie
She was so fine, I went to get her early
Shirley was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my naval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed, then I got on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that TP treatment",

And all is (well, well, well, well)

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (well, well, well, well)
Wit' my Earth in the wind smoking fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit' Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex

I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see

To My Loves I gone, I gotta know
Where do we go from here, I gotta know

Dear God, I remember when times was hard
Gunshots echoed the block like passin' cars
I miss my cousin Lance look out for him
I love him, he died so young you musta had a place for him
My Uncle Kevin, the family miss him
He in Heaven, I ain't really understand 'till I turned seven
Every year that go by
I try to understand why (I understand why)
Everytime someone born, somebody gotta die
It's sad, I hate to see my mama cry
It's okay, come here mom and wipe your eyes
It's hard ta focus, kids playin' in school thinkin' they soldiers
Teachers can't teach now they nervous
Sittin' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose (I don't know)
Sittun' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose

The fast life is much too short, that's what we all thought
In and out of courts for assualts of all sorts
Seein' you go had me feelin' low
Just ta know a brotha was about to blow
But the world was killin' him slow
Your fans miss you wit a passion
And they wonder are you still alive and still laughin'
I still stress over your death
Caught four in to your chest
Lay your rest to the west
May your soul be blessed
And Lord knows how we miss you
Murder is a big issue
Can't stop the blood wit tissue
When the slugs hit you
All your family and friends shed tears
Cause for years
We knew you would make it, it was clear
Toast to both coasts
We need to stand close
Cause it ain't no silence when God is right in front of your eyes
Awakin' the time to shine
In time you'll find
I roll a dutch
Cause the worlds to much, to take my pain away

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a ""Queen Bee Rules"" tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark 'til the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

[Chorus: Sisqo]
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?

How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?

Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah, mmm
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man

727,Peggy Lee,Fever,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
When you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever! In the mornin', a-fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night

And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever
When you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever! In the mornin', a-fever all through the night

That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""
Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever! I'm a fire, fever, yeah, I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy, oh, don't you dare""
He gives me fever
With his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever! I'm his missus, daddy, won't you treat him right?
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever
When you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever! 'Til you sizzle

732,Jason Isbell,If We Were Vampires,"It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

In a slightly different order each day

And I see flashes of the shape of your breasts
And the curve of your belly
And they make me have to sit down and catch my breath

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
*Woman moaning*

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

If these walls could talkX
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat, & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh)


[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat, & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh)

[Instrumental Break]


[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room",

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking damn shit knowing damn well I was a virgin

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying God don't let me bust quick
I'm watching pornos tryin' see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get something off my mental

At the right place and right time, maybe tonight
And the whisper or handshake sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard, wait never mind
Late night, and passing, mention it flipped her
Best friend, who knows saying maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror and a crush to light
When she walked in, he froze up, believe its the fright
Its cute in a way, till you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette, your knees get weak
An escape is just a nod and a casual wave
Obsessed about it, heavy for the next two days
It's only just a crush, it'll go away
It's just like all the others it'll go away
Or maybe this is danger and he just don't know
You pray it all away but it continues to grow

Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close

As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart
Then he walked up and told her, thinking that he'd passed
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare
They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do
'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last
Either way he wanted her and this was bad
He wanted to do things to her it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

You're so lovely
Intelligent too
Your demeanor is sweetness
And everything you do, yeah
Ease my whole world with
Your delicate smile
You're so precious
Stylish dressing
But that's not what this is about, no

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a pain, there's a pain
That lies deep inside
And as time goes on
It gets harder to hide
And I feel it in my heart
And I know you do too
Well there's just no other way
So I'm asking you

[Chorus]
To take off your pants
When I know
There's just no better way to say
Say what I gotta say
So take off your pants
I wanna see you
Just let me heal you
It's what we got to do

[Verse 2]
I love, I love, I love the way
They slide right down your legs
And your skin's so silky smooth
Keep it trimmed
But you're not shaved, yeah, yeah
All week
We've been buildin' up this tension
Let them drop down to your ankles
So we can work out our aggression

[Chorus]
Take off your pants
Sometimes to make right
You've gotta make love
And I'll thank the stars above you
Take off your pants
I wanna feel your skin
Next to my skin, baby
Well I, I wanna get in
Ooh-whoo

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Let's, Let's just relax)

See we've done
Just about everything we can
Oh lord

Sometimes, baby, words can just get in the way
Maybe if we just let our bodies talk to each other
They'll know exactly what to say
Let me ask you

If I take something off
Would you take something off
If I take something off
Would you take something off
If I take something off
Would you take something off
If I take something off
Would you take it off

Take off-
Yo wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold up, hold up
Stop!

[Bridge]
I believe
That you believe
That we could achieve
This sexuality
Consensually
Because I love you
But right now, baby
Oh right now
All I wanna do
Is f*ck you

[Chorus]
Take off your pants
Baby, see, I've gone on my knees
And I'm, I'm begging you please
Baby, take off your pants
See, what do I, what, lord, do
I got to do for you
Baby, to prove that my love is true
Sing it with me, sing

Take off
Your pants
Take off
Your pants
Take off
Your pants

Well I love you
And I want you
And I need you
To take off your

Pants

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along
So now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
""Fuck yeah, give it to me""
""This is Heaven, what I truly want""
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, ""Baby, that's alright with me""
No one's gonna take my soul away

""Fuck yeah, give it to me""

Innocence lost
When you talk, it's like a movie
And you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me, ""Life isn't that hard""
No one's gonna take my soul away

Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows

I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' to waste more time on the couch
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine, yeah
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run, I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed
Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags

Your confusion
My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

Naked to see
Walking on air
Hunting by the rivers, through the streets, every corner
Abandoned too soon
Set down with due care
Don't walk away in silence

I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh, wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want, you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine

Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again)
(I'll use my hands)
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)

Thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Taste the whip of shiny, shiny leather
Ooh, shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, cure his heart
Severin', severin' or speak so slightly
Severin' down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
Severin' taste the whip
Severin' taste the whip, now plead for me
Oh, I'm tired, and I'm weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would, that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant don't forsake him
Strike mistress and cure his heart",

In an open car
To tempt you in
And drive you far away
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
Love is a danger
Of a different kind
To take you away
And leave you far behind
And love love love
Is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it
And you still can't
Get enough of the stuff
It's savage and it's cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
And it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And you're left like a zombie
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
It's guilt edged
Glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession",

845,Bruce Springsteen,For You,"Princess cards she sends me with her regards
barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
To her Cheshire smile. I・ll stand on file, she・s all I ever wanted.
But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts
honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back
you wouldn・t even give me time to cover my tracks.
You said, ：Here・s your mirror and your ball and jacks；.
But they・re not what I came for, and I・m sure you see that too
I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency
I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency
and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free

Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak
reveal yourself all now to me girl while you・ve got the strength to speak
Cause they・re waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks
But I could give it all to you now if only you could ask.
And don・t call for your surgeon even he says it・s too late
It・s not your lungs this time, it・s your heart that holds your fate
Don・t give me money, honey, I don・t want it back
you and your pony face and your union jack
well take your local joker and teach him how to act
I swear I was never that way even when I really cracked
Didn・t you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
you could laugh and cry in a single sound.

And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?

You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek
That ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leech.
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore
So you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for
and it・s not that nursery mouth I came back for
It・s not the way you・re stretched out on the floor
cause I・ve broken all your windows and I・ve rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?
And you should know that・s trueK
I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency
I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency
and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free",

Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water

To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So... you'll never know
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, ya know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that
Really he has no one
So I'll wait for you, love
And I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh-oh, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams
He had you with him
My body turns
And yearns for a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles
When I've slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh-oh-oh, lover
You should've come over, yeah, yes
Yes, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run

This time I won't repent

Feel it now and don't resist
This time the anger's better than the kiss

I tend to lose it than confront my mind

For what I've done to you

The monster speaks
Reveals his face and searches for relief

Attracted only 'til it comes unglued
And it don't bleed
And it don't breathe
It's locked its jaws

But who's countin

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palms
Mister mischief with a trick up this sleeve
All up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get when I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit, Ah shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped on foster kids
These rooms make me hallucinate then I sweet till I start losin weight
Till I see bumb shit start happenin
Remember Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce. I said come on bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb ass, sit down we don't bullshit. Better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Cause all your mom's is passin out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she frazzles out
Fuck that someone help Danon
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin on these leprechauns
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Yeah I took midol with some parmesean
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm bout to die when I just got on?
Yo? stop actin stupid. You so high that you
Might wake up with a guy on some new shit

Yeah, I think I did too much. Uh huh.

Red pills, blue pills, and green.

Dirty dozen. 80 of us Shady brothers
Ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers'
Love us but they hate each other.
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other.

Pop pills. Pills I pop. Pop 2 pills on steps I walk
Snort 2 lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back and I'm a scar for days

While I'm overweight look for dope to smoke no ok-a-dok
I'm packing my nose for coke
Am I supposed to choke
Had an accident when the trojan broke
Awwww poor baby born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a infant
(You're crazy)

I pop 4 E's at one time and I don't need water when
I'm swallowin mine. Hey, you got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We cant get jobs cause our arms so tracked
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too(Swift chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue weed,
Shrooms, down to valiums, Even smoke week outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

Gin and tonic demonic. Bodies smell like vomit
Pussy poppin, acid droppin, dope headed guy
Heron mesculine pencil legs wanna try

You know you want it in your butt

872,No Doubt,Underneath It All,"There's times where I want something more

And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had

I guess it's not that bad

Better better
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps callin
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
that this here woman that adore
Aside from your temper
Everything is secure
You're good for me, baby
of that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied

She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' on, keep movin' on""

Tired of myself, tired of this town

Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You've got to put on that party dress

That my life would depend on the morning sun

Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

Beyond the seas of thought beyond the realm of what
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not
Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind
But please realize you'll probably be surprised
For it's the land unknown to man
Where fantasy is fact
So if you can, please understand
You might not come back
Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see
How happy life could be if all of mankind
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
．Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
．Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of M?nchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!

There's nothing you can teach me

""So I always keep a bottle near""

""This me, yeah baby, and the rest""

I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older

I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

Never knowing who to trust like this

All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs (hey)
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing

If I just took time to plan it
Told me secrets you ain't wanna

I love how it was when it was just me and you
They know the truth so we gon' watch how we move
But nothin' beats the feelin' that you givin' me
Even if it ain't forever, ooh
Just keep it honest, we made some promises
They got opinions, but that won't change a thing
We got each other, let's shut the world up
And take our clothes off, baby, yeah

Why after all this time I'm finally worth it?
Ain't it funny, how power comes with money
And how now I'm out here poppin'
They come back like they're an option

I'm staying over at yours tonight
I call in late, let's exercise
There's something buried in your eyes
Draws me in and I can't hide
I'm clocking in today, I'm on one
I came in hard, I hope you don't run
I tell him all about it, but even I would doubt it
They never seen the things that you do
You, when it's good I'm questioning
You, then I stop to take it in
Is my head in the way?
'Cause my heart can't explain
Where we going now?
Build it up, we tear down
Cared before but baby
Now, I don't give a fuck
All the way down
On a one way to you
All the way down
No matter what you're going through
Take it in, Take it in
All I wanna do is
Stay with it, stay with it
And I know that you won't
Play with it, play with it
Are you ready? Hold on
Take it in, Take it in
All I wanna do it
Stay with it, stay with it
And I know that you won't
Play with it
Hold on
When it's good, I'm questioning
You (you), then I start to take it in
Is my head in the way?

Where we going now?
Build it up, we tear down
Cared before but baby
Now, I don't give a fuck

All the way down
All the way down
All the way down

When it comes to love I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin' don't say a word 'cos I already heard
What your body's saying to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
We got the time

'Cos I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I've found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love I want a slow hand

If I want it all night, please say it's alright
It's not a fast move but a slow groove
On my mind

'Cos I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I've found somebody who will understand
I've found a lover with a slow hand

Lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush",

Many will know anything goes
Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be

Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human

Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with,
The Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you,
It's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope (Ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now)

'Cross the room throwin' signals I'm throwin' 'em back
Flirt-in cause I, digs you like that
Peep baby boy style, hopin' we match
You sent me Crown Royale with a note attached
It said, ""You look like the type that, know what you like""
I could tell by the jewels you go for the ice
Plus you wear the shoes well, the suits flows nice
I don't like the notes too well, let's be more precise
Meet me by the VIP let's pow-pow
Whisper in my ear like, ""Boo let's bounce now""

Gettin' my flirt on, playa, ain't nothin'
You tryin to say the right words to get us out of here

And his smile blind like the shine on his necklace
Mind tellin' me no, body tellin' me exit
Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses, uhh
Twist my body like the Excorist, hey
The way he licked his lips he was mackin'
True thug passion, I'm like, ""Slow down before you crashing""
Never mind him, he ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way we sex, on the villa up in Malibu
Marry who? Daddy please
I'm takin' it all from the stash to the keys

Ooooooh baby, baby I need you
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Right here
Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
Outside of the club talkin' to Valet
Mind started to stray, million miles away
Contemplatin' goin back to his crib to par-lay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-Ta's perkin', You're makin' me high
Like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to Reality, the Soul II Soul
Breathin' heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said
Tonight baby
Ooooooh baby, c'mon c'mon Foxy c'mon
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Whatever you want me to do (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Ooooooh baby, do it for you baby

991,Miguel,Coffee,"[ChorusGMiguel]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1: Miguel]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge: Miguel]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Part-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge](x2)
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight

We could both say goodbye

998,Norah Jones,Turn Me On,"Like a flower
Waiting to bloom
Like a lightbulb
In a dark room
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

Like the desert waiting for the rain
Like a school kid waiting for the spring
Im just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

My poor heart
It's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all you're the one who turns me off
You're the only one who can turn me back on

My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on",
