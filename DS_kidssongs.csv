Particles of bigger things

50,Three Little Kittens,"Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall
But the first didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall
But the second didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn't fall, fall
So the work didn't bother him at all
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
Little pig, little pig let me in
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
But the bricks surely did not go
The wolf was at its wits end you see
He climbed on the roof down the brick chimney
He came with his teeth all bare, bare, bare
So the three little pigs got scared
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, ""Ow, ow, ow!""
And the wolf ran out of town
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard worked job won't fall, fall, fall
To a huff or a puff at all"

Little cat, little cat
Cece saw a little cat
Its fur was soft as snow
And everywhere that Cece went
Cece went, Cece went
Everywhere that Cece went
The cat was sure to go
She followed her around the store
'Round the store, 'round the store
She followed her around the store
Pouncing at her feet
It made the family laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the family laugh and play
To see a cat so sweet
Cece saw a little cat
Little cat, little cat
Cece saw a little cat
Its fur was soft as snow
And everywhere that Cece went
Cece went, Cece went
Everywhere that Cece went
The cat was sure to go
Why does the cat love Cece so
Cece so, Cece so?
Why does the cat love Cece so?
Her father wondered why
""Cece loves the cat, you know
Cat you know, cat you know
Cece loves the cat you know""
Her mother did reply
Now Cece loves her little cat
Little cat, little cat
Now Cece loves her little cat
It's time to take her home"

130,Three Little Pigs,"Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall
But the first didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall
But the second didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn't fall, fall
So the work didn't bother him at all
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
Little pig, little pig let me in
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
But the bricks surely did not go
The wolf was at its wits end you see
He climbed on the roof down the brick chimney
He came with his teeth all bare, bare, bare
So the three little pigs got scared
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, ""Ow, ow, ow!""
And the wolf ran out of town
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard worked job won't fall, fall, fall
To a huff or a puff at all"

While the moon her watch is keeping,

While the weary world is sleeping,

Visions of delight revealing,
Breathes a pure and holy feeling,
All through the night.

Clear through the night;

Home through the night.
Earthly dust from off thee shaken,
By good angels art though taken;
Soul immortal shalt though waken,
Home through the night.

All through the night.
God is here, thou'lt not be lonely,

Night's dark shades will soon be over,
Still my watchful care shall hover.

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come.
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear.
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear. Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for ev'ryone
And there's a cross for me.

Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love.
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above.

Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees,
Sweet freedom's song.
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.


Our fathers' God to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing.
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King!


Our glorious land today,
'Neath education's sway,
Soars upward still.
Its halls of learning fair,
Whose bounties all may share,
Behold them ev'rywhere,
On vale and hill!


Thy safeguard, liberty,
The school shall ever be
Our nation's pride!
No tyrant hand shall smite,
While with encircling might
All there are taught the Right
With Truth allied."

148,The Arkansas Traveler,"Oh, once upon a time in Arkansas,
An old man sat in his little cabin door,
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear,
A jolly old tune that he played by ear.
It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't care,
He sawed away at the popular air,
Tho' his rooftree leaked like a waterfall,
That didn't seem to bother the man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day,
And stopped to hear him a-practicing away,
The cabin was a-float and his feet were wet,
But still the old man didn't seem to fret.
So the stranger said ""Now the way it seems to me,
You'd better mend your roof,"" said he.
But the old man said as he played away,
""I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day.""


The traveler replied, ""That's all quite true,
But this, I think, is the thing to do,
""Get busy on a day that is fair and bright,
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.""
But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel,
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel.
""Get along,"" said he, ""for you give me a pain,
My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain."""

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;


He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my condemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on."

And the lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings,

Wish they'd bring him back,
He chased the big hogs through the fence,
And the little ones through the crack.

Boil that cabbage down.

Met a possum in the road,
Blind as he could be,
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog,
And bristled up at me.


Boil that cabbage down,
Bake that hoecakes brown,
Craziest song I ever heard,
Boil that cabbage down.

Once I had an old gray mule,
His name was Simon Slick,
He'd roll his eyes and back his ears,
And how that mule would kick!

Craziest song I ever heard,
Boil that cabbage down.

For my gal fell up there,
And lost her new front tooth.

In search of recreation,
Took enough provisions along
To spend a vacation.

Except a piece of bologna.

But it's no use of carving;
If we do, there isn't enough
To keep us all from starving.""
""I suggest we all go to bed.
Then,"" said Pat Mahoney,
""He who has the nicest dream,
Wins the bologna.""

At twenty after seven.
One man said, ""I dreamt that I died,
And went straight up to Heaven.
I swept through the beautiful gates,
Riding on a pony.
You can't beat a dream like that,
So I win the bologna.""

Died from overeating;
I went up to Heaven myself.
Oh, what a greeting!
Old Saint Peter smiled and he said,
'How are you, Maloney?'
You can't beat a dream like that,
So I win the bologna.""

I know you two aren't lying.

Oh, how I was crying!
You went up to heaven and then,
While I felt so lonely,
I dreamt you weren't coming back,
So I ate the bologna!"""

Fell into the foaming brine.

Blowing bubbles soft and fine,

So I lost my Clementine.

Oh, my darling Clementine,
You are lost and gone forever,

Fertilized by Clementine.

I spied a cowpuncher riding along.
His hat was throwed back and his spurs were a-jingling,
And as he approached he was singing this song:
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

Early in the springtime we round up the dogies,
Mark 'em and brand 'em and bob off their tails.
Round up the horses, load up the chuck wagon,
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail.


Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.


Night comes on and we hold 'em on the bedground,
The same little dogies that rolled on so slow.
We roll up the herd and cut out the stray ones,
Then roll the little dogies like never before.


Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

Some boys go up the long trail for pleasure,
But that's where they get it most awfully wrong.
For you'll never know the trouble they give us,
As we go drivin' them dogies along.


Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home."

Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas.

Just before the battle, the General hears a row
He says ""The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now.""
He looks down the roadway, and what d'ya think he sees?
The Georgia Militia cracking goober peas.


Peas, peas, peas, peas,
Eating goober peas.
Goodness, how delicious,
Eating goober peas.

I think my song has lasted just about enough.
The subject is interesting, but the rhymes are mighty rough.
I wish the war was over, so free from rags and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, say good-bye to goober peas.

230,My Grandfather's Clock,"My grandfather's clock
Was too large for the shelf,
So it stood ninety years on the floor;
It was taller by half
Than the old man himself,
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.
It was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born,
It was always his treasure and pride;
But it stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
His life seconds numbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
It stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.

In watching its pendulum
Swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent while a boy;
And in childhood and manhood
The clock seemed to know,
And share both his grief and his joy.
And it struck twenty-four
When he entered at the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride;


But it stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
His life seconds numbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
It stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.


Ninety years without slumbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
His life seconds numbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
It stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.


My grandfather said
That of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found;
For it wasted no time,
And had but one desire,
At the close of each week to be wound.
And it kept in its place,
Not a frown upon its face,
And its hand never hung by its side.


But it stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
His life seconds numbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
It stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.


It rang an alarm
In the dead of the night,
An alarm that for years had been dumb;
And we knew that his spirit
Was pluming his flight,
That his hour of departure had come.
Still the clock kept the time,
With a soft and muffled chime,
As we silently stood by his side.
But it stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
His life seconds numbering,
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
It stopped short
Never to go again,
When the old man died."
231,Grasshoppers Three,"Grasshoppers three a-fiddling went

232,Great Granddad,"Great Granddad, when the land was young,
Barred the door with a wagon tongue,
For the times was rough and the redskins mocked,
And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked.
Twenty-one children came to bless,
The old man's home in the wilderness,
They slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats,
And they hunted in the woods in their coonskin caps.

Great Granddad was a busy man,
Cooked his grub in a frying pan,
He picked his teeth with his hunting knife,
And he wore the same suit all his life."

293,The Lord's Prayer,"The Lord is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.
I feed in green pastures, safe folded, I rest.
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when opprest,
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when opprest.
Thro' the valley and shadow of death tho' I stray,
Since Thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear.
Thy rod shall defend me, Thy staff be my stay,
No harm shall befall me with my Comforter near,
No harm shall befall me with my Comforter near.

In the midst of affliction, my table is spread!
With blessings unmeasured, my cup runneth o'er;
With perfume and iil Thou anointest my head;
O what shall I ask of Thy providence more?
O what shall I ask of Thy providence more?


Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above.
I seek, by the path which my forefathers trod,
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love,
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love."

Doing turns like a bird
He flies without wings

He flips and he flies
High above you and I
I wonder when he will come down

In only one hand
He must be the bravest
In all of the land
He flips and he turns
Oh where did he learn
To fly the way that he does"

In her rocking chair.

Down to the sea,
No one's as dear
As baby to me.
Wee little fingers,
Eyes wide and bright
Now sound asleep
Until morning light."

""Indeed, I have not any.""

Simple Simon went a-fishing
For to catch a whale;
All the water he could find
Was in his mother's pail!


Simple Simon went to look
If plums grew on a thistle;
He pricked his fingers very much,
Which made poor Simon whistle.


He went to catch a dicky bird,
And thought he could not fail,
Because he had a little salt,
To put upon its tail.


He went for water with a sieve,
But soon it ran all through;
And now poor Simple Simon
Bids you all adieu."

Four and twenty blackbirds
Baked in a pie.

The birds began to sing,
Oh wasn't that a dainty dish
To set before the king?

The king was in his counting house
Counting out his money,
The queen was in the parlour
Eating bread and honey.


The maid was in the garden
Hanging out the clothes,
When down came a blackbird
And pecked off her nose!

In the merry merry month of May
I was taken by surprise
By a pair of roguish eyes
I was scared but I didn몭t run away

He walked along so daintily
Moving as graceful as can be
His legs were like the trunks of trees
I hardly came up to his knees
He looked at me again
And I knew we would be friends
He몭s just a little bigger than me!

He had the cutest baby too
About as old as me and you
Maybe soon one day
We could all go out and play
And be friends with one
Elephants in the park

He walked along so daintily
Moving as graceful as can be
I though I몭d seen a lot of things
From New York to Colorado
Springs
From his tail up to his trunk
From the back up to the front
The elephant is so astonishing
This elephant is so astonishing
This elephant is so astonishing"

I몭ve got green alligators
And long-necked geese
Some humpty-backed camels
And some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants
But Lord I몭m so forlorn
I just can몭t see no unicorn

Through the driving rain
The unicorns were hiding
Playing silly games
Kicking and splashing
While the rain was pouring
Oh, them silly unicorns

There몭s green alligators
And long-necked geese
Some humpty-backed camels

If you think that I can몭t do it
Boy will you be surprised

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, 몮Let몭s run
And we몭ll have some fun
Now before I melt away몯

Had a silver lining
One day he몭ll stop by again
Never more a stranger

Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo.

The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old coyote howls.

All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing lower and some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire
And some just clap their hands or paws,
Or anything they got now.

Listen to the top where the little birds sing
On the melodies with the high notes ringing,
The hoot owl hollers over everything
And the jaybird disagrees.

Singin' in the night time, singing in the day,
The little duck quacks, then he's on his way.
The 'possum ain't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself.

All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing lower and some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire
And some just clap their hands or paws,
Or anything they got now.

It's a simple song of living sung everywhere
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear,
The grumpy alligator the hawk above,
The sly raccoon and the turtle dove.

Some sing out loud on the telephone wire
And some just clap their hands or paws,
Or anything they got now."

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Big bad wolf, big bad wolf?
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
Tra la la la la.

Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy-wigs
For the big, bad very big very bad wolf
They didn't give three figs.

Number one was very gay
And he built his house of hay
With a hey hey toot
Hey blew on his flute
And he played around all day.

Number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Heigh diddle-diddle
He played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs.

Number three said ""Nix on tricks
I will build my house with bricks.""
He had no chance
to sing and dance
'Cause work and play don't mix.

Ha ha ha! The two little
Do little pigs just winked and laughed. Ha ha!

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Big bad wolf, big bad wolf?
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
Tra la la la la.

Came the day when fate did frown
And the wolf blew into town.
With a gruff ""puff-puff"" he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down.

One and two were scared to death
of the big bad wolfie's breath.
""By the hair of your chin-ny-chin,
I'll blow you in.""
And the twig house answered yes.

No one left but number Three
To save the piglet family.
When they knock
He fast unlocked
And said, ""Come in with me!""

Now they all were safe inside
And the bricks hurt wolfie's pride
So, he slid down the chimney
And, oh, by Jimney
In the fire he was fried.

Ha ha ha!
The three little, free little pigs rejoice and laughed.
Ha ha!

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Big bad wolf, big bad wolf?
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?

And left in a wood, so I've heard folks say.

Pretty babes in the wood
Pretty babes in the wood
Oh, don't you remember
Those babes in the wood

Now the day being gone and the night coming on
Those two little babies sat under a stone
They sobbed and they sighed, they sat there and cried
Those two little babies they laid down and died

Pretty babes in the wood
Pretty babes in the wood
Oh, don't you remember
Those babes in the wood

Now the robins so red, how swiftly they sped
They put out their wide wings and over them spread
And all the day long on the branches they throng
They sweetly did whistle and this was their song

Pretty babes in the wood

Oh, don't you remember

got lost on their way.

Poor babes in the wood!
poor babes in the wood!
Oh! don't you remember
those babes in the wood?

Among the trees high
Beneath the blue sky
They plucked the bright flowers
And watched the birds fly;
Then on blackberries fed,
And strawberries red,
And when they were weary
'We'll go home,' they said.


Poor babes in the wood!
poor babes in the wood!
Oh! don't you remember
those babes in the wood?

And when it was night,
So sad was their plight,
The sun it went down,
And the moon gave no light!
They sobbed and they sighed
and they bitterly cried
and long before morning,
they lay down and died.

Poor babes in the wood!
poor babes in the wood!
Oh! don't you remember
those babes in the wood?


And when they were dead,
the robins so red,
brought strawberry leaves
and over them spread
And all the day long,
on the branches did throng,
They mournfully whistled,
And this was their song:

Poor babes in the wood!
poor babes in the wood!
Oh! don't you remember
those babes in the wood?"

Bile dat cabbage  down
Bake dat hoe-cake brown
Craziest song I ever heard,
Bile dat cabbage down.

Met a possum in the road,
Blind as he could be,
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog
And bristled up at me.

Bile dat cabbage down
Bake dat hoe-cake brown
Craziest song I ever heard,
Bile dat cabbage down.
Once I had an old gray mule,
His name was Simon Slick,
He'd roll his eyes and back his ears,
And how that mule would kick!

Bile dat cabbage down
Bake dat hoe-cake brown
Craziest song I ever heard,
Bile dat cabbage down.

There's gold up in them there hills,
I know it for the truth,
For my gal fell up there
And lost her new front tooth.

Bile dat cabbage down
Bake dat hoe-cake brown
Craziest song I ever heard,
Bile dat cabbage down."
699,Billy Blunder,"One rainy morning
Without any warning
A large umbrella crossed the street
Big, black and shiny
Covering someone tiny
And all that we could see were two small feet

In and out the traffic
Dodging here and there
That umbrella went with a Don't-Care air
I said in wonder
Who is that down under
Hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear

Horns started blaring
Everyone was staring
At that strange object in the street
Big black and shiny
Covering someone tiny
And all that we could see were two small feet

Then a young policeman
Called out from his beat
""That umbrella there has a boy down deep""
He swooped down under
Pulled out Billy Blunder
Just a tiny truant from his morning's sleep

Now Billy Blunder
Who was once down under
Recites by heart his safety code
""When you are out
In rain or hail or thunder
Hold up your umbrella when you cross the road!"""
700,Blacksmith's Apprentice,"A smith had an apprentice once
Who was not very fa-a-a-a-ast,
Of all the workers in the crew
He always was the last.
But this is what he did at noon
When lunch was served for all;
He was the first one in the line,
He never missed the call.

Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
We're just as gay as we can be.
Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
There's none as gay as we.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we can be.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we.

The blacksmith said to him,
""My boy, I wonder, yes I do-o-o-o-o.
I always thought that 'slow at work'
Meant 'slow at eating' too.
With you, it doesn't work that way,
You save your hands and feet.
At work, you're slow and lazy,
But you hurry when you eat.""

Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
We're just as gay as we can be.
Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
There's e0d none as gay as we.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we can be.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we.

""You wonder, well, I'll tell you!""
Said the young man with a ro-o-o-o-oar,
""We eat a mere one-hour lunch,
But work for FOURTEEN more.
Now, if I'd use those fourteen hours
To lunch instead of work,
I'd eat as slowly as could be,
But work I would not shirk!""

Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
We're just as gay as we can be.
Hallee halloh, halloh hallee,
There's none as gay as we.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we can be.
Tra la la, tra la la,
As gay as we."
701,Blow the Man Down,"I'll sing you a song, a good song of the sea
With a way, hey, blow the man down
And trust that you'll join in the chorus with me
Give me some time to blow the man down

There was an old skipper I don't know his name
With a way, hey, blow the man down
Although he once played a remarkable game
Give me some time to blow the man down

His ship lay be-calmed in the tropical sea
With a way, hey, blow the man down
He whistled all day but in vain for a breeze
Give me some time to blow the man down."

710,Chocolate Ice Cream,"My mama said if I'd be good,

She'd send me to the store

She said she'd bake some Gingerbread

If I would sweep the floor


She said if I would make the bed

And watch the telephone

That she would send me out to get

A chocolate ice cream cone


And so I did the things she said

And then she made some Gingerbread

Then I went out, just me alone

And got my chocolate ice cream cone


While coming back I stubbed my toe

Upon a big old stone

Now need I tell you that I dropped

My chocolate ice cream cone


A little puppy came along

And he took a great big lick

And so I hit that mean old dog

With just a little stick


Then he bit me where I sit down

And he chased me all over town

So, now I'm lost, I can't find my home

And all because of that chocolate ice cream cone

And all because of that chocolate, (Chocolate acc e-yodel)

Chocolate ice cream cone"

To the circus I went
I didn't have a nickel,
I didn't have a cent

The circus man said
To see the show without a cent,
I'd have to carry water
For the elephant.

I carried water for the elephant,
Back and forth to the well I went
My arms got sore and my back got bent
But I couldn't fill up that elephant

I said to the dude
In the stand-up collar
""I'll bet you five bucks
That elephant's hollow""

He handed me a ticket,
Said, ""First you'll see
The animals in
The menagerie.""

First I sawed the lion
And the lion roared
I saw the wild sloth
And the wild sloth snored

I saw the wild snake
And the wild snake hissed
I saw the wild bee
And the wild bee bumbled

I saw mister possum
Sittin' on a limb
A big black bear
Sittin' next to him

I saw the d6f little monkey,
Like in a zoo
The wild rooster said
""Cockle doodly doodle doo""

I saw the hippopotamus
Splash in the water
Trying to dance with
The crocodile's daughter

I saw the gazelle
And the big kangaroo
I heard an owl holler
""Hoo, hoo, hoo""

I saw the wild donkey
And the wild donkey brayed
I saw the wild horse
And the wild horse neighed

I saw the wild seal
And the wild seal barked
I saw the giraffe
And the giraffe yelled...

I went down to the circus tent
I sure am doggone glad I went
I saw the whole show -- didn't cost a cent
Because I carried water for the elephant."

Excavating for a mine
Lived a miner forty-niner

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove her ducklings to the water
Every morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles soft and fine
But alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Then the miner, forty-niner
Soon began to peak and pine
Thought he oughta join his daughter
Now he몭s with his Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

There몭s a churchyard on the hillside
Where the flowers grow and twine
There grow roses, 몬mongst the posies
Fertilized by Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In my dreams she still doth haunt me
Robed in garlands soaked in brine
Though in life I used to hug her
Now she몭s dead, I draw the line

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Now you scouts may learn the moral
Of this little tale of mine
Artificial respiration
Would have saved my Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her, how I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
Till I kissed her little sister
And forgot my Clementine

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
715,Come Little Leaves,"
Come, little leaves,
Said the wind one day;
Come to the meadows
With me and play.
Put on your dresses
Of red and gold;
For summer is past,
And the days grow cold.

Soon as the leaves
Heard the wind's loud call,
Down they came fluttering,
One and all.
Over the meadows
They danced and flew,
All singing the soft
Little songs they knew.

Dancing and flying,
The leaves went along,
Til Winter called them
To end their sweet song.
Soon, fast asleep
In their earthy beds,
The snow lay a coverlet
O'er their heads."

739,Grandfather's Clock,"My Grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,
So it stood ninety years on the floor.
It was taller by half than the old man himself,
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.

It was bought on the morn of the day he was born,
It was always his treasure and pride,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,
Many hours he spent as a boy.
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know,
And it shared both his sorrow and joy.

And it struck twenty-four when he entered the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tock, tick, tick,
It's life seconds numbering, tick tock, tick, tock,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

My Grandfather said that of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found.
It wasted no time and it had one desire,
At the end of the week to be wound.

And it stayed in its place, not a frown upon its face,
And it's hands never hung by it's side,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

Now it rang an alarm in the still of the night,
An alarm that for years had been dumb.
We knew that his spirit was pluming in flight,
That his hour of departure had come.

Still the clock kept its time with a soft and muffled chime,
As we silently stood by his side,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tock, tick, tick,
It's life seconds numbering, tick tock, tick, tock,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died."

From folks that he meets
Who deserves tricks
And who deserves treats.
Great Pumpkin is coming to town!

He'll search in every pumpkin patch,
Haunted houses far and near
To see if you've been spreading gloom,
Or bringing lots of cheer.

Oh, you'd better not shriek,
You'd better not groan,
You'd better not howl,
You'd better not moan,
Great Pumpkin is coming to town!"

On a rocket ship high in the air
Yes, I'd like to visit the moon
But I don't think I'd like to live there
Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
I would miss all the places and people I love
So although I might like it for one afternoon
I don't want to live on the moon

I'd like to travel under the sea
I could meet all the fish everywhere
Yes, I'd travel under the sea
But I don't think I'd like to live there
I might stay for a day there if I had my wish
But there's not much to do when your friends are all fish
And an oyster and clam aren't real family
So I don't want to live in the sea

I'd like to visit the jungle, hear the lions roar
Go back in time and meet a dinosaur
There's so many strange places I'd like to be
But none of them permanently

So if I should visit the moon
Well, I'll dance on a moonbeam and then
I will make a wish on a star
And I'll wish I was home once again
Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
I would miss all the places and people I love
So although I may go I'll be coming home soon
'Cause I don't want to live on the moon
No, I don't want to live on the moon"

759,Irish Lullaby (Too-Ra-Loo-Ra),"Over in Killarney
Many years ago,
Me Mither sang a song to me
In tones so sweet and low.
Just a simple little ditty,
In her good 'ould' Irish way,
And I'd give the world if she could sing
That song to me this day.

""Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, don't you cry!
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, that's an Irish lullaby.""

Oft in dreams I wander
To that cot again,
I feel her arms a-huggin' me
As when she held me then.
And I hear her voice a-hummin'
To me as in days of yore,
When she used to rock me fast asleep
Outside the cabin door.

Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Hush, now don't you cry!

Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,

And one golden sun
And a smile means
Friendship to ev'ryone
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide

761,It's Not Easy Being Green,"It's not that easy being green;
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves.
When I think it could be nicer being red, or yellow or gold...
or something much more colorful like that.

It's not easy being green.
It seems you blend in with so many other ord'nary things.
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're
not standing out like flashy sparkles in the water
or stars in the sky.

But green's the color of Spring.
And green can be cool and friendly-like.
And green can be big like an ocean, or important like a mountain,
or tall like a tree.

When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why, but why wonder why?
Wonder, I am green and it'll do fine, it's beautiful!
And I think it's what I want to be."
762,Johnny Rebeck,"Away out in the forest
There lived a mean old man
His name was Mr. Johnny Rebeck
And he could surely plan
All the neighbors' cats and dogs
Were always at his feet
So he invented a machine
That turned them all to meat

Hey Mr. Johnny Rebeck,
How could you be so mean
We told you you'd be sorry
For inventing that machine
All the neighbors' cats and dogs
Will never more be seen
They've all been ground to sausages
In Johnny Rebeck's machine

One day a boy came walking,
He walked into the store
He bought a pack of sausages
And placed them on the floor
Then he began to whistle,
He whistled up a tune
And all the little sausages,
They danced around the room

Hey Mr. Johnny Rebeck,
How could you be so mean
We told you you'd be sorry
For inventing that machine
All the neighbors' cats and dogs
Will never more be seen
They've all be ground to sausages
In Johnny Rebeck's machine

One day the darn thing busted,
The darn thing wouldn't go
So Johnny Rebeck climbed inside
To see what made it so
His wife she had a nightmare
While walking in her sleep
She gave the crank a great big yank
And Johnny Rebeck was meat

Hey Mr. Johnny Rebeck,
How could you be so mean
We told you you'd be sorry
For inventing that machine
All the neighbors' cats and dogs
Will never more be seen
They've all been ground to sausages
In Johnny Rebeck's machine"
763,Kindergarten Song,"There's lots of things I learned,
When I was back in kindergarten,
I learned most of what I needed to know
About how to live, what to do, and how to be,
I picked the wisdom from the top of the learning tree,
From how to love a friend, to how to match my socks,
I got it all right there in the sandbox, oh,
Kindergarten taught me what I needed to know.

I learned how to play fair, and share,
And put things back where I found them,
Talk nice, think twice,
And say you're sorry to kids if you hurt them,
Don't tease, say please,
If something's not yours, then you shouldn't take it,
Eat right, don't fight,
And clean up the mess if you make it, yeah!
I said, clean up the mess if you make it, yeah!

I remember all the things that I learned,
When I was back in kindergarten,
And I've got a lot of things
That I've picked up along the way,
But everything I know, and everything I gain,
I just add to what I learned about Dick and Jane,
Because the roots go down, and then we all grow up,
Juse like the little seed in the plastic cup,
Oh, kindergarten taught me, what I needed to know.

I learned how to play fair, and share,
And put things back where I found them,
Talk nice, think twice,
And say you're sorry to kids if you hurt them,
Don't tease, say please,
If something's not yours, then you shouldn't take it,
Eat right, don't fight,
And clean up the mess if you make it, yeah!
I said, clean up the mess if you make it, yeah!

Think of what a different world it would be,
If we could all have cookies and milk at three,
Every afternoon, we'd take a nap after we eat.
Nobody would fight, we'd have peaceful days,
'Cause when we looked at a problem, we'd look both ways,
And we'd stick together, when we had to cross the street

If I could take all the leaders in the world,
And put them back in kindergarten,
Maybe they'd remember what they learned
About how to live, what to do, and how to be,
Wisdom from the top of the learning tree,
They'd see that love makes friends,
They'd learn to not throw rocks....,
Just like they learned it back in the sandbox, oh,
Kindergarten taught me what I needed to know,

The whole world could play fair, and share,
And put things back where we found them,
Talk nice, think twice,
Say we're sorry to kids if we hurt them,
Don't tease, say please,
If something's not ours, then we shouldn't take it,
Eat right, don't fight,
And clean up the mess if we make it, yeah!
I said, clean up the mess if we make it, yeah!"

Don't want a little tisket,
Or a little tasket,
Just a little kitty in a basket.

I'll warm her milk and dress her in pajamas.
I'll make a bed for her in Daddy's shoe.
And if she starts in crying for her Mamma,
She can bring along her Mamma
And her sisters and her brothers too.

Don't have to be as pretty as a posey,
And I promise not to laugh if she only has a half a tail.

Safe in their starlit beds,
And as the moon comes creeping
They nod their fragrant heads.
The drowsy, budding branch lets fall
An air that seems to call:
Sleep a while, sleep a while,
My children, sleep a while.

The birds that sang so bravely
Are silent in the nest,
The sun itself has gravely
Found pillows in the west.
The cricket as he grinds away
Works all night long to say:
Sleep a while, sleep a while,
My children, sleep a while.

The Sandman comes in gliding
Up to each sleepyhead
To see if someone's hiding
Who should have gone to bed
And when a yawning child he spies,
He drops sand in his eyes.
Sleep a while, sleep a while,
My children, sleep a while."

770,Little Tin Soldier,"Once in a town in the black forest
A little white toy shop stood
And a little tin soldier with only one leg
Lived in a castle of wood
And across the room on another shelf
Stood a little glass shelf

And a tiny ballerina lived in there
All in a dress of lace
And from where the little tin soldier stood
They could see each other so clear
And the little tin soldier watched over her
With a love that was so dear

Then one day sadness came
The tiny ballerina was sold
The little tin soldier was thrown away
And into the gutter he rolled

The water carried him to the sea
And many far-off lands
He made many children happy
As he passed through their tiny hands

But then one day they met again
In a house in the land of Eire
When the clock on the wall struck the midnight hour
They jumped into a fire

And in this fire oh they will stay
Forever and a day
For the fire, Lord, is the fire of love
Just like the peaceful dove"

Seat belts, everyone!

Please, let this be a normal field trip

[Wanda:]
With the Friz?

[Kids:]
No way!

[Arnold:]
Oh!

Cruisin' on down Main Street
You're relaxed and feelin' good
Next thing that you know you're seein'
Octopus in the neighborhood!

Surfin' on a sound wave
Swingin' through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars

On the magic school bus
Navigate a nostril
Climb on the magic school bus
Spank a plankton, too (Take That!)
On our magic school bus
Raft a river of lava
On the magic school bus
Such a fine thing to do!

So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and don't be shy
Come on
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie

On the magic school bus
Step inside it's a wilder ride!
Come on!
Ride on the magic school bus!"

So she called for the doctor to come quick, quick, quick.
The doctor came with his bag and his hat,
And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.

Wobble, wobble, wobble;
Mister Turkey talking,
""Gobble, gobble, gobble."""

""I am going to Sneeze!""

So he put his head down
Between his knees!
(Put head down between knees)

He opened his mouth
And out it flew
(Open mouth)

A giant super loud
""ACHOO!""
(Sneeze loudly)

The jungle floor jiggled
And the trees all wiggled
(Wiggle and jiggle body)

And the birds were flown
To Bombay

And the elephants were tossed
Every which way
(Slap hands on knees)

Mr. Lion looked up and roared,
(Look up)

""Oh my, a windstorm just passed!"""
781,Mr. Nobody,"I know a funny little man,
As quiet as a mouse,
Who does the mischief that is done
In everybody's house!

There's no one ever sees his face
And yet we all agree
That every plate we break was cracked
By Mr. Nobody.

'Tis he who always tears our books,
Who leaves the door ajar,
He pulls the buttons from our shirts
And scatters pins afar;

That squeaking door will always squeak,
For, prithee, don't you see,
We leave the oiling to be done
By Mr. Nobody.

He puts damp wood upon the fire,
That kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud,
And all the carpets soil.

The finger marks upon the door
By none of us are made;
We never leave the blinds unclosed,
To let the curtains fade.

The ink we never spill; the boots
That lying round you see
Are not our boots; -- they all belong
To Mr. Nobody."

If you'll only take the trouble

It isn't any trouble
Just to ha-ha-ha-ha laugh
It isn't any trouble
Just to ha-ha-ha-ha laugh
So laugh when you're in trouble,
It will vanish like a bubble
If you'll only take the trouble

It isn't any trouble
Just to G-R-I-N, grin

Just to G-R-I-N, grin

It will vanish like a bubble
If you'll only take the trouble

784,Smokey the Bear,"With a Ranger's hat and shovel
and a pair of dungarees,
you will find him in the forest
always sniffin' at the breeze.
People stop and pay attention
when he tells 'em to beware,
'cause ev'rybody knows that
he's the Fire Prevention Bear.

Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.
Prowlin' and a growlin' and a sniffin' the air.
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.
That's why they call him Smokey,
That was how he got his name.

You can take a tip from Smokey
that there's nothin' like a tree.
'cause they're good for kids to climb in
and they're beautiful to see,
you just have to look around you
and you'll find it's not a joke,
to see what you'd be missin'
if they all went up in smoke.

Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.
Prowlin' and a growlin' and a sniffin' the air.
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.
That's why they call him Smokey,
That was how he got his name.

You can camp upon his doorstep
and he'll make you feel at home;
You can run and hunt and ramble
anywhere you care to roam.
He will let you take his honey
and pretend he's not so smart,
but don't you harm his trees
for he's a Ranger in his heart.

Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.
Prowlin' and a growlin' and a sniffin' the air.
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.
That's why they call him Smokey,
That was how he got his name.

If you've ever seen the forest
when a fire is running wild,
and you love the things within it
like a mother loves her child,
then you know why Smokey tells you
when he sees you passing through,
""Remember...please be careful....
its the least that you can do.""

Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.
Prowlin' and a growlin' and a sniffin' the air.
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.
That's why they call him Smokey,
That was how he got his name."

787,My Pony Boy,"Way out west, in a nest from the rest, dwelt the bestest little Bronco Boy
He could ride, he could glide o'er the prairies like an arrow.
Every maid in the glade was afraid he would trade his little heart away,
So each little peach made a nice little speech of love to him;

Pony Boy, Pony Boy, won't you be my Tony Boy?
Don't say no. Here we go off across the plains.
Marry me, carry me right away with you.
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, whoa! My Pony Boy.

Till one day, out that way, so they say, came to stay a fluffy ruffle girl.
She made eyes, she surprised, and he found his heart was lassoed.
When he thought he was caught, how he fought, but she taught this pony boy to love.
But he balked when she talked of a trip to New York, so she sang to him;

Pony Boy, Pony Boy, won't you be my Tony Boy?
Don't say no. Here we go off across the plains.
Marry me, carry me right away with you.
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, whoa! My Pony Boy.

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, whooooooa! My Pony Boy"

A little kid should know
It's all about the devil
And I've learned to hate him so
She said he causes trouble
When you let him in the room,
He will never ever leave you
If your heart is filled with gloom

So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never lose
And frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy
The devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts to running
When the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy
'Cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling
He'll get tired of hanging 'round.

If I forget to say my prayers
The devil jumps with glee
But he feels so awful awful
When he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble
And you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never lose
And frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart
And let the sun shine in."

Outside my window. She's not singing just for me.

Please don't cut her home. You love her just like me

Won't you also care? That little bird, who
Sings, oh so sweetly, struggles through your smokey air.

She flies in spring, north, where it's cooler
She builds there her nest in it lay her eggs, they
soon will be her babies. She sings to them while they rest.

Please, woodcutter, south of the border,
Please don't cut that tree. A little bird is singing
Outside my window. She's not singing just for me."

Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, Jackie paper came no more
And puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his life-long friend, puff could not be brave,
So puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. oh!

We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened our path for a while

Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

Won't you think of the valley you're leaving
Oh how lonely, how sad it will be?
Oh think of the fond heart you're breaking
And the grief you are causing to me

As you go to your home by the ocean
May you never forget those sweet hours
That we spent in the Red River Valley
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers"
