50,Three Little Kittens,"Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall
But the first didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall
But the second didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn't fall, fall
So the work didn't bother him at all
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
Little pig, little pig let me in
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
But the bricks surely did not go
The wolf was at its wits end you see
He climbed on the roof down the brick chimney
He came with his teeth all bare, bare, bare
So the three little pigs got scared
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, ""Ow, ow, ow!""
And the wolf ran out of town
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard worked job won't fall, fall, fall
To a huff or a puff at all",clean

One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall
But the first didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall
But the second didn't care at all
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn't fall, fall
So the work didn't bother him at all
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
Little pig, little pig let me in
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
And boy! Did the hay house go
Little pigs, little pigs let me in
Not by the hair on our chinny-chin-chins
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow, blow, blow
But the bricks surely did not go
The wolf was at its wits end you see
He climbed on the roof down the brick chimney
He came with his teeth all bare, bare, bare
So the three little pigs got scared
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, ""Ow, ow, ow!""
And the wolf ran out of town
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard worked job won't fall, fall, fall

And grace will lead me home.How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear.

An old man sat in his little cabin door,
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear,

It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't care,
He sawed away at the popular air,
Tho' his rooftree leaked like a waterfall,
That didn't seem to bother the man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day,
And stopped to hear him a-practicing away,
The cabin was a-float and his feet were wet,
But still the old man didn't seem to fret.
So the stranger said ""Now the way it seems to me,
You'd better mend your roof,"" said he.
But the old man said as he played away,
""I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day.""


The traveler replied, ""That's all quite true,
But this, I think, is the thing to do,
""Get busy on a day that is fair and bright,
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.""
But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel,
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel.
""Get along,"" said he, ""for you give me a pain,
My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain.""",clean

It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

Early in the springtime we round up the dogies,
Mark 'em and brand 'em and bob off their tails.
Round up the horses, load up the chuck wagon,
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail.


Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,

Night comes on and we hold 'em on the bedground,
The same little dogies that rolled on so slow.
We roll up the herd and cut out the stray ones,
Then roll the little dogies like never before.


Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies,

But that's where they get it most awfully wrong.

Swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent while a boy;
And in childhood and manhood
The clock seemed to know,
And share both his grief and his joy.
And it struck twenty-four
When he entered at the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride;


But it stopped short

That of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found;
For it wasted no time,
And had but one desire,
At the close of each week to be wound.
And it kept in its place,
Not a frown upon its face,
And its hand never hung by its side.

Was pluming his flight,
That his hour of departure had come.

With a soft and muffled chime,
As we silently stood by his side.

When you’re so small
But one day soon
It’s gonna change
As you start to get all
Try and do your best
As you face
Each and every day
All it takes is that first step
To get you on your way

Oh harmony
You gotta have harmony
There’s nothin’ like the
Special feeling that comes from
Harmony
Livin’ in harmony
And when we are
All together and singin’
Life is better in harmony

Some humpty-backed camels
And some chimpanzees

Out of anybody’s name

I treat it like it wasn’t there

And then say “bo”
Add a “B” then I say the name
Then “bo- na- na, fana” and “fo”

With an “F” very plain,
Then a “fee fi” and a “mo.”
And then I say the name again
With an “M” this time
And there isn’t any name
That I can’t rhyme

Arnold!
Arnold, Arnold, bo-bar-nold
Bo-na-na, fan-na fo-far-nold,
Fee fi mo-mar-nold
Arnold!

But if the first two letter
Are ever the same
Drop the both,
Then say the name
Like Bob, Bob
Drop the “B’s,” bo-ob
Or Fred, Fred
Drop the “F’s,” fo- red
Mary, Mary
Drop the “M’s,” mo- rar- y
That’s the only rule
That is contrary

Say “Bo”
(Bo)
Now Tony with a “B”

Now bo-na-na, fan-na and fo
(Bo-na-na, fan-na fo)
Now you say the name again
With an “F,” very plain
Then a fee, fi and a mo
And then you say the name again
With an “M” this time
And there isn’t any name
That you can’t rhyme

Stand on their tails
And move so fast
Perfect timing from the first

Some are bigger than me

As they float and fly
It almost seems like
They’re up in the sky

When their flippers wave
For jugglin’ balls

With a giant crash
Don’t get wet
From their mighty splash

Now before I melt away”

Right to the traffic cop

Little handsome piggy-wigs
For the big, bad very big very bad wolf
They didn't give three figs.

Number one was very gay
And he built his house of hay
With a hey hey toot
Hey blew on his flute
And he played around all day.

Number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Heigh diddle-diddle
He played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs.

Number three said ""Nix on tricks
I will build my house with bricks.""
He had no chance
to sing and dance
'Cause work and play don't mix.

Do little pigs just winked and laughed. Ha ha!

And the wolf blew into town.
With a gruff ""puff-puff"" he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down.

One and two were scared to death
of the big bad wolfie's breath.
""By the hair of your chin-ny-chin,
I'll blow you in.""
And the twig house answered yes.

No one left but number Three
To save the piglet family.
When they knock
He fast unlocked
And said, ""Come in with me!""

Now they all were safe inside
And the bricks hurt wolfie's pride
So, he slid down the chimney
And, oh, by Jimney
In the fire he was fried.

739,Grandfather's Clock,"My Grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,
So it stood ninety years on the floor.
It was taller by half than the old man himself,
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.

It was bought on the morn of the day he was born,
It was always his treasure and pride,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,
Many hours he spent as a boy.
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know,
And it shared both his sorrow and joy.

And it struck twenty-four when he entered the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.
Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tock, tick, tick,
It's life seconds numbering, tick tock, tick, tock,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

My Grandfather said that of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found.
It wasted no time and it had one desire,
At the end of the week to be wound.

And it stayed in its place, not a frown upon its face,
And it's hands never hung by it's side,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

Now it rang an alarm in the still of the night,
An alarm that for years had been dumb.
We knew that his spirit was pluming in flight,
That his hour of departure had come.

Still the clock kept its time with a soft and muffled chime,
As we silently stood by his side,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.

Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tock, tick, tick,
It's life seconds numbering, tick tock, tick, tock,
And it stopped short, never to go again, when the old man died.",clean

Who leaves the door ajar,
He pulls the buttons from our shirts
And scatters pins afar;

That squeaking door will always squeak,
For, prithee, don't you see,
We leave the oiling to be done
By Mr. Nobody.

He puts damp wood upon the fire,
That kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud,
And all the carpets soil.

To let the curtains fade.

and you'll find it's not a joke,
to see what you'd be missin'

and he'll make you feel at home;
You can run and hunt and ramble
anywhere you care to roam.
He will let you take his honey
and pretend he's not so smart,
but don't you harm his trees
for he's a Ranger in his heart.

when a fire is running wild,
and you love the things within it
like a mother loves her child,

when he sees you passing through,
""Remember...please be careful....
its the least that you can do.""
